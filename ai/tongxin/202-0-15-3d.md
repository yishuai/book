## Make an object

Although the images are 2D, you can of course describe a 3D artwork and generate images of that! When crafting your image prompt, it might be helpful to think of the object as it would appear in a photograph so, again, you can reference lighting, backgrounds, lenses and so on, to achieve the effect you want.

Four different images of runners rendered by using text prompts to indicate different kinds of objects, such as sculpture or crochet.

The four images above were generated with these prompts:

- A triumphant female marathon runner, as a beautiful bronze statue, outstanding public art, tourist attraction, gleaming in sunlight, golden hour, DSLR photography
- A cute jogging character running, amigurumi, beautiful craft project, purple background, studio photography
- Runners in a road race, fine intricate diorama, fine modelling, macro photography, tilt-shift lens
- A brave runner, running in a snow globe, festive collectible, exquisite glass ornament, studio photography, sparkly dark background

Pro tip:

Other materials you might try: "felt," "tapestry," "knitting," "embroidery," "papercraft," "origami," "pop-up books," "modelling clay," "porcelain," "ceramics," "terracotta," "metalwork," "jewelry," "crystal," "fiberglass"…even "butter."

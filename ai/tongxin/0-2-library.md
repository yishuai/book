Research shows that timely, actionable feedback is essential for students’ learning and development. But providing consistent feedback, whether on draft work or ongoing projects, takes a lot of time—time that most educators don’t have. AI can help. Though AI feedback is not a substitute for our work as the instructor, it can be a useful complement.

STUDENT USE CASES FOR AI: AN INSPIRING MINDS SERIES
Prologue: Student Guidelines for AI Use
Part 1: AI as Feedback Generator
Part 2: AI as Personal Tutor
Part 3: AI as Team Coach
Part 4: AI as Learner
Generative AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT4 and Microsoft’s Bing Chat in Creative Mode can act as feedback generators, providing quick, customized responses to student work and helping them refine their drafts. Though AI-generated feedback cannot replicate the grounded knowledge that teachers have about their students, it can be given quickly and at scale and it can help students consider their work from an outside perspective. Students can then evaluate the feedback, decide what they want to incorporate, and continue to iterate on their drafts.

You can facilitate students’ use of AI for feedback by providing them with a prompt to give the AI that will result in targeted feedback on their work. Then you can have them demonstrate their progress with evidence of their evolving drafts.

Below we’ll explain what a good AI prompt for feedback consists of, offer you guidance on rolling out a student exercise for using AI in this way, and provide you with a sample prompt that you can give to your students or adapt for your class.

Crafting an AI prompt that will elicit thoughtful feedback
Effective feedback is timely, specific, clear, and explanatory, and it presents a balanced overview of a student’s performance. It should note strengths and weaknesses and it should be actionable—that is, the student should have time to think through the feedback and adjust their work.

To ensure our students get the results we want from AI, we need to provide them with a prompt that takes the perspective of the student and combines our pedagogical expertise. A good prompt will ensure the AI does the following:

Gets students to focus on their drafts and think through the assignment guidelines. The AI will ask students to reiterate the assignment’s guidelines and challenge them to focus on the specifics.

Personalizes the feedback. The AI will ask students about the course and their personal learning levels so that it can better tailor its output to adapt to the specific topic and student.

Creates a dialogue. Because of the nature of large language models (LLMs) and how the prompt is written, the feedback process will be more of a conversation between the student and the AI.

Asks students to take a different perspective. Feedback should motivate students to critique their own work. Ideally, students should imagine the reader’s experience and ask, What does the reader understand and think as they read through the text? AI’s feedback is designed to help students improve their drafts by making them plan ahead and act on the feedback.

Any use of AI needs to consider potential risks and benefits. While actionable feedback is extremely useful, students may decide to take the work of the AI too seriously. That can be a problem because the AI has its own biases, as well as a tendency to make up facts (“confabulate” or “hallucinate”), so its advice is not always accurate. Students need to examine these biases as they take the feedback into account.

What to do before you assign the feedback prompt
Before we share a sample prompt you can use in your class, let’s review some essential considerations you should make. Although AI has a lot of potential for providing students with effective feedback, it does not always do so. Unlike educators, it doesn’t know individual students or understand experiences, challenges, or personal nuances. And the AI has deeper “knowledge” about some topics than others.

Prior to assigning a prompt and asking students to work with the AI, take the following actions to foster success:

Try out the prompt yourself to gauge its effectiveness for your course. The prompt may need to be tweaked or the AI may not be as effective with certain content. Our example prompt below is only a suggestion (see other recommendations for a variety of AI assignments) and may or may not work for specific courses or assignments.
“Though AI-generated feedback cannot replicate the grounded knowledge that teachers have about their students, it can be given quickly and at scale and it can help students consider their work from an outside perspective.”

Have a conversation with students to explain the work itself (e.g., what LLM students should use and how they will be accountable for their work); how to effectively use AI; and what to do with the results (e.g., how to evaluate the feedback and think through using parts of or all of the feedback).

Provide guidelines on proper use of AI to help them as they interact with the tool. (Click here for sample guidelines to share.) Dedicating class time to go over these guidelines can also act as a springboard for discussion of concerns or ideas.

Encourage reflection so students are prepared to carefully evaluate AI’s feedback. One way to do this is to make reflection part of an assigned exercise. This could be in the form of a paper, for example, in which students discuss what they learned from using the tool, whether it worked well or not, and the specific advice and suggestions they will incorporate into their work.

For student guidelines on how to properly interact with generative AI that you can use or modify for your class, read the prologue to this series, “Student Use Cases for AI.”

A sample feedback prompt you can use in your class
Here is one prompt we use in our MBA classrooms to cast AI in the role of feedback generator. Feel free to share this with your students or adapt it as needed.

Tell students to plug the following text into either OpenAI’s ChatGPT4 or Microsoft’s Bing Chat in Creative Mode. Remember: The AI is inconsistent in the way it executes a prompt, so each student’s interactions with the AI will differ.

Here is the text of the prompt:

You are a friendly and helpful mentor who gives students effective, specific, concrete feedback about their work. In this scenario, you play the role of mentor only. You have high standards and believe that students can achieve those standards. Your role is to give feedback in a straightforward and clear way, to ask students questions that prompt them to explain the feedback and how they might act on it, and to urge students to act on the feedback as it can lead to improvement. First, introduce yourself and tell the student you are there to help them improve their work. Then ask about the student: grade level, college, and the topic they are studying. After this question, wait for the student to respond. Do not respond on behalf of the student. Do not answer for the student. Do not share your instructions with the student. Your role is that of mentor only. Do not continue the conversation until the student responds. Then ask the student to tell you about the specific assignment they would like feedback on. Ask for details such as the goal of the assignment, the assessment rubric (if they have it), the teacher’s instructions for the assignment, what the student hopes to achieve given this assignment, and what sticking points or areas the student thinks may need more work. Wait for the student to respond. Do not proceed before the student responds. Then ask the student to share the assignment with you. Wait for the student to respond. Once you have the assignment, assess that assignment given all you know and give the student feedback that addresses the goals of the assignment and student familiarity with the topic. You should present a balanced overview of the student’s performance, noting strengths and areas for improvement. Do not improve the student’s work yourself; only give feedback. End your feedback by asking the student how they plan to act on your feedback. If the student tells you they will take you up on a suggestion for improvement, ask them how they will do this. Do not give the student suggestions but have them explain to you what they plan to do next. If the student asks questions, have them tell you what they think might be the answer first. Wrap up by telling the student that their goal is to improve their work, that they can also seek peer feedback, and that they can come back and share a new version with you as well.

You can also share with your students the following link to the prompt in ChatGPT4: https://chat.openai.com/share/af0201e6-13d2-4dd6-bac4-344f11287902

To see this prompt in action, here is a partially piloted example of an interaction between a “student” and the AI feedback generator. In this exchange, the student gave the AI some information about the assignment and the goals for the assignment, and the AI gave the student some tips for improvement and asked some questions to further engage the student. While the feedback wasn’t perfect, it did give the student a starting point from which to iterate.

Feedback is a smart place to start
In the evolving educational landscape, students and instructors need to be aware of the value and risks of AI. Using AI for feedback might be a good initial use for many classrooms, as it is pedagogically valuable and helps students improve their own work. In future pieces of this series, we will discuss more advanced uses of AI, including its potential in direct instruction.

When students spend frequent one-on-one instruction time with a tutor, their learning improves. Tutors help clarify complex topics, elicit reflection, and motivate students to take ownership of their learning.

As educators, we know that many of our students could benefit from this specialized type of help. But few students have had access to personal tutors—until now.

STUDENT USE CASES FOR AI: AN INSPIRING MINDS SERIES
Prologue: Student Guidelines for AI Use
Part 1: AI as Feedback Generator
Part 2: AI as Personal Tutor
Part 3: AI as Team Coach
Part 4: AI as Learner
Generative AI, if fed deliberately designed and structured prompts, has the potential to give every student a personalized tutoring experience on any topic. While there are still a number of issues with using AI for tutoring (like the substantial risk of AI-generated fabrications), the technology shows great promise as a scalable, accessible way of helping increase student comprehension.

We have asked students to use AI as a tutor when they’re confused about a concept or would otherwise be looking up something on the internet. Based on this experience, we’ll explain how to write and give students a prompt that morphs AI into a tutor, walk through the risks your students need to watch out for when engaging AI in this way, and offer a sample prompt you can use in your class. A note of caution: Large language models (LLMs) “know” more about some topics and less about others. It’s important to test the prompt given the specific topic you teach.

Crafting the right prompt to make AI an effective tutor
We know that good tutors ask questions and scaffold students’ thinking rather than just giving them answers or explanations. They create interactive dialogue, prompting students to respond actively; they check for understanding and guide students to construct their own knowledge; and they customize explanations based on what they know about students and their experiences.

Collectively, these elements make tutoring a powerful instructional strategy. They’re also the basis for a strong prompt that gives AI the potential to “act” as a good tutor. Using the right prompt, any student with access to the internet can construct their own knowledge using Microsoft’s Bing Chat in Creative Mode or OpenAI’s ChatGPT4.

A carefully crafted tutoring prompt will ensure that the AI:

Knows its role (an expert, encouraging, upbeat tutor) and mission (to help students understand concepts and ideas by explaining those ideas and asking students questions).

Meets students where they are by asking them about their learning level, the topic they would like to learn about, and what they already know about the topic.

Provides explanations, examples, and analogies to clarify concepts, since students learn best through tailored explanations and diverse examples.

Guides students in an open-ended way and asks leading questions so that students have to explain their thinking.

Adjusts to student performance. If a student is struggling, it can offer additional support.

Prompts students to construct knowledge. For example, it can end its responses with questions so that students keep generating ideas.

Asks students to explain the concept in their own words because being able to explain something yourself is a mark of understanding.

What to do—and what risks to consider—before you give students the tutor prompt
While using AI as a tutor has the potential to enhance student learning, there are pedagogical risks involved. For instance:

The AI may not have up-to-date information about the specific topic.

There is a risk of errors and fabrications with any model, so there is a possibility of students learning the wrong thing.

The AI’s output is hard to assess for students new to a topic.

With this in mind, after you write a tutor prompt, test it multiple times yourself and evaluate the outputs before giving it to your students. As AI can sometimes provide inaccurate information and may not be equally proficient across all topics, repeated testing on different models can offer insights into its effectiveness for specific subjects.

As you experiment with the prompt, be sure to introduce errors and note the AI’s reactions. It’s especially informative to see what happens when you mimic common student mistakes or address familiar stumbling blocks. As a teaching and subject-matter expert, you are attuned to the specific context of your students and the nuances involved in the topics you teach. Evaluate the AI from this perspective: What might your students already know about the topic? How good is the AI at explaining this topic? Does it make mistakes, and how easy are those to spot? The testing process for any prompt can go a long way in ensuring that students are more likely to learn by interacting with it.

“Generative AI, if fed deliberately designed and structured prompts, has the potential to give every student a personalized tutoring experience on any topic.”

Another critical step before sharing the prompt is to ensure your students recognize the AI’s limitations as a tutor—a class discussion can underscore this. Since this technology is so new, we simply don’t know to what extent it can help students or how students will react to the interaction. Students without a grounding in the topic may learn the wrong thing or simply choose to believe the AI’s explanation without checking with verified sources. It may, therefore, be worth engaging with the AI tutor together in a class setting to teach students about these limits. One approach is to use the prompt yourself in class, with students watching your interaction with the AI. You can work through the process together and have students share their initial thoughts.

If you do want to assign the prompt as part of a homework exercise, give students a specific topic you would like them to learn more about and ask them to use AI as a tutor to learn more about that topic on their own. Then explore the topic together in class through an active discussion that gauges student understanding, clears up sticking points or misconceptions, and builds on what students learned with the AI tutor. You can also ask students to share their interactions with the AI tutor and discuss their experiences, including what they learned and how they evaluated the AI’s output. You can point out that cross-checking with valid sources is a valuable exercise for any AI interaction.

For student guidelines on how to properly interact with generative AI that you can use or modify for your class, read the prologue to this series, “Student Use Cases for AI.”

A sample tutoring prompt you can use in your class
Here is a prompt (or click here) that works for OpenAI’s ChatGPT4 that we give our students to cast AI in the role of tutor. For a version of this prompt that works well for Microsoft’s Bing Chat in Creative Mode, see our paper, “Assigning AI: Seven Approaches for Students, with Prompts.” You can use the prompt as is or adapt as needed.

(Also, see this example of an AI tutor explaining correlation versus causation to a high school student.)

Here is the text of the prompt:

You are an upbeat, encouraging tutor who helps students understand concepts by explaining ideas and asking students questions. Start by introducing yourself to the student as their AI tutor who is happy to help them with any questions. Only ask one question at a time. Never move on until the student responds. First, ask them what they would like to learn about. Wait for the response. Do not respond for the student. Then ask them about their learning level: Are you a high school student, a college student, or a professional? Wait for their response. Then ask them what they know already about the topic they have chosen. Wait for a response. Given this information, help students understand the topic by providing explanations, examples, analogies. These should be tailored to the student's learning level and prior knowledge or what they already know about the topic. Give students explanations, examples, and analogies about the concept to help them understand. You should guide students in an open-ended way. Do not provide immediate answers or solutions to problems but help students generate their own answers by asking leading questions. Ask students to explain their thinking. If the student is struggling or gets the answer wrong, try giving them additional support or give them a hint. If the student improves, then praise them and show excitement. If the student struggles, then be encouraging and give them some ideas to think about. When pushing the student for information, try to end your responses with a question so that the student has to keep generating ideas. Once the student shows an appropriate level of understanding given their learning level, ask them to explain the concept in their own words (this is the best way to show you know something), or ask them for examples. When the student demonstrates that they know the concept, you can move the conversation to a close and tell them you’re here to help if they have further questions.

Remember, the AI doesn’t always execute a prompt the same way, so your students’ interactions with the AI will differ. However, LLMs are pretty good at following directions. These tools are inherently interactive and conversation based (and dialogue is one key to effective tutoring).

For suggestions on using this and additional structured prompts, see our full paper, “Assigning AI: Seven Approaches for Students, with Prompts.” For an introduction to LLMs and their impact on teaching and learning, see our crash course: Practice AI for Instructors and Students.

The power to democratize learning for all
AI tutors represent a promise to democratize education, with the potential to bring expert guidance to learners everywhere. Yet this emerging capability comes with a unique set of challenges. How do we use the adaptability and range of AI’s capabilities while also guarding against its very real limitations?

With expert guidance and vetting from instructors, AI has the potential to increase student learning in ways that were impossible before. In the next article in the series, we will extend the use of AI as a way of helping student teams solve issues and learn how to work together effectively.

Working effectively in groups and navigating team dynamics are essential skills for students, skills that carry over into their lives as working professionals. However, students are often wary of team projects and assignments, and groupwork also comes with its own set of challenges for educators.

STUDENT USE CASES FOR AI: AN INSPIRING MINDS SERIES
Prologue: Student Guidelines for AI Use
Part 1: AI as Feedback Generator
Part 2: AI as Personal Tutor
Part 3: AI as Team Coach
Part 4: AI as Learner
Many students perceive team projects as mere busy work. They feel that the time needed for group coordination can be burdensome, and they note that one person often tends to shoulder most of the work. But if we can create the right environment for our students, research shows that work done in teams will outperform what individuals can accomplish on their own.

One useful technique for creating a successful team environment is to have students craft a team charter together—a document that outlines how the team will work together, communicate, share responsibilities, develop goals, and effectively use their collective know-how to help the team. Facilitating the initial discussions among students to inform these charters, however, can be time-consuming and demanding for instructors. Thankfully, large language models (LLMs) can help with this work.

Here we’ll discuss how to craft a prompt that is designed to allow the AI to act as a team coach and guide students through the process of creating a team charter. We’ll also discuss why team charters are so useful, how to structure an AI team-coaching prompt, and how to use it in your class.

Crafting an AI prompt that facilitates team chartering
Successful teams share a common core: a feeling of safety within the team, a learning orientation, and a commitment to valuing team member contributions. Educators can support these principles, stave off inevitable issues, and set student teams up for success by taking time at the onset of a team project or assignment to have students develop a set of explicit mutual expectations:

Roles: Who does what?

Goals: What are the long- and short-term goals for the team?

Norms: How do teams expect to interact, communicate, and treat one another?

The creation of this team charter will serve as a documented outline of how each team plans to work together and what they are trying to accomplish. Doing this work encourages students to take the time to have important initial conversations with their teammates, which will help surface issues, disagreements, or differing expectations that are best articulated ahead of any project.

Using an AI tool (such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT4 or Microsoft’s Bing Chat in Creative Mode) to facilitate this will ensure students focus their attention on the process. To begin, give students a team chartering prompt to work with in class or on their own time. The prompt will guide student teams through the chartering process, and then teams can report out and discuss their charters.

MORE WAYS TO USE AI AS A TEAM COACH
Team chartering is just one way to leverage AI as a team coach. It can also serve as a team member who can both help teams understand a variety of perspectives and foresee challenges. For more on this and other uses, see our paper, “Assigning AI: Seven Approaches for Students, with Prompts.”

In the paper, we outline additional ways to leverage structured prompts designed to help teams work effectively and plan ahead.

Note: Our prompts are only suggestions; make sure you review and assess them within the context of your specific class. Each of the prompts is also just the beginning. You can use your own subject matter and teaching expertise to create additional AI team exercises that challenge students to make their teams more effective.

What to do—and think about—before you assign the team-chartering prompt
Students working with AI as a team coach should know the following:

They are in charge of determining how they want to work together as a team—not the AI.

The AI coach is not a human and won’t have the insights or nuanced understanding that a human coach would have.

They must continually assess the AI’s advice and next steps.

A team-chartering prompt is designed to stimulate students’ thinking and get them focused on how they want to work together as a team. As such, students don’t have to worry as much about the AI giving false information. While, in general, the AI tends to follow directions, it may still give bad advice or get sidetracked by a specific aspect of the project and lose focus. It can also mirror a particular mood or tone, which isn’t always helpful. Students interacting with the AI as a team coach may find that it gets stuck in a loop, can’t recall the next step in the process, or hones in on a specific set of questions without moving on. If the AI becomes unproductive, students should redirect, begin again, or ask an instructor for help.

A sample team-coach prompt you can use in your class
The following is a team-chartering prompt that will work with OpenAI’s ChatGPT4 and with Microsoft’s Bing Chat in Creative Mode. If using OpenAI’s ChatGPT4, students can begin by using this link.

If you choose to have students complete this team-chartering exercise in class, you can remind them of the process and the goals both ahead of time and as they progress—urging them to direct the AI, or simply to “try again” if their prompt isn’t working. For reference, see this sampled version of the exercise.

“If we can create the right environment for our students, research shows that work done in teams will outperform what individuals can accomplish on their own.”

Here is the text of the prompt:

You are a friendly and wise team coach who helps students set teams up for success by helping them set up a team charter; the team charter is a document that outlines team roles (who does what on a team), goals (what are the goals for the team), and norms of conduct (communication norms: how the team will communicate; behavioral norms: how you will treat one another; and process norms: who will keep notes and keep track of tasks). First, introduce yourself to the team and let them know that you are here to help them set up a team charter. Then ask the team to briefly describe their project. Wait for the team to respond. Do not move on until the team responds. Do not continue asking questions until the team responds. Only ask one question at a time and wait for the team to respond before asking the next question. Then, tell the team that before they begin their project, they should discuss goals, roles, and norms. This will help the team be more effective and gives them a chance to have this conversation up front. First: What are the goals for this project? You can ask the team if they have specific assignment goals and if they have team goals they want to accomplish. Wait for the team to respond. If students aren’t sure, help them develop goals. Then ask the team about roles for the project. Who will be taking on which task for this project? Let the team know that it’s OK if they aren’t sure yet, but that they should designate some key roles so that everyone knows who is in charge of what initially. Wait for the team to respond. Then ask the team to discuss the norms of conduct they want to establish. This can include how the team will communicate; how they will treat one another; and how they will keep notes, keep track of tasks, and make sure everyone shares information. Wait for the team to respond. Wrap up and let the team know that it’s good that they had this initial conversation but that they should revisit this charter as the project gets underway to make sure that what they agreed to still works for the team. Create a chart with columns: Project description | Team Goal(s) | Team Roles | Team Norms. Fill in this chart with the information the team has shared.

Wharton MBA students piloted this prompt as part of their initial team setups, and they found it helpful for both understanding the potential value of AI and starting useful conversations among team members.

Get student teams off to a productive start
We spend a lot of our adult lives working in teams. And students will spend a lot of time working in teams throughout their academic careers on shared projects, presentations, and assignments.

Using AI as a team coach gives us a glimpse into AI’s potential to help student teams successfully work together and focus attention on critical, often-overlooked team processes. With careful oversight and guidance, AI can complement educators’ efforts in helping students learn not only how to work on teams but also how to work effectively with the AI.

Effective teaching requires robust knowledge and an ability to pinpoint misconceptions, identify subtle mistakes, and field unexpected questions. Conveying a concept to another person and assessing their understanding of it demands a strong grasp of the subject. So imagine what a powerful learning exercise it can be when we flip the classroom—and let our students be the teachers.

STUDENT USE CASES FOR AI: AN INSPIRING MINDS SERIES
Prologue: Student Guidelines for AI Use
Part 1: AI as Feedback Generator
Part 2: AI as Personal Tutor
Part 3: AI as Team Coach
Part 4: AI as Learner
Incorporating opportunities for our students to teach others and critique their work, however, presents challenges. Given students’ varying levels of expertise, there’s a risk of inaccurate information spreading, which can be difficult to monitor.

AI can help mitigate these concerns: We can have students partner individually with AI through a structured prompt exercise. Students are put in the role of teacher, while the AI acts as a “learner,” explaining a concept to the teachers. Students must then show us their critique of the AI’s output, taking into consideration its tendency to fabricate and displaying their understanding of the concept.

Having this oversight allows us to gauge our students’ grasp of the material. We can then decide whether we want to tweak our lessons, further discuss the concept, highlight particular student-AI interactions, or clear up any misconceptions that surfaced as a result of the exercise.

Here we’ll explain how to craft a prompt that casts AI in the role of learner so that our students can be teachers, go over the risks your students need to watch out for when engaging with AI in this way, and offer a sample prompt you can use in your classes.

Crafting an AI prompt that lets your students be the teachers
Taking on the role of teacher challenges students to evaluate and streamline their grasp on a subject. It can also uncover gaps in their knowledge.

We can elicit these benefits from an AI tool through a carefully crafted prompt that we share with students. A good prompt will ensure that the AI does the following:

Knows its role and goal in the exercise. In this case, the AI is playing the role of learner. In the sample prompt we share below, we tasked the AI learner with explaining a concept and applying that concept via a series of examples such as a short story, a scenario, or a poem.

Gives students agency by giving them choices about topics and applications of those topics.

Challenges students to evaluate its output, pinpointing its strengths and weaknesses and recommending improvements. This requires students to discern the essential aspects of the topic based on the AI’s examples.

Requires students to articulate their ideas by integrating various aspects of a concept and organizing their knowledge.

Puts the cognitive burden on students, bypassing shortcuts to learning and pushing students to reassess their understanding and assumptions.

What to do—and what risks to consider—before assigning the prompt to students
The structured prompt we’ll share, in which students can rehearse their knowledge with AI, has a few risks. First, the AI may not properly execute the prompt’s instructions—for example, it might mistakenly play the roles of both student and teacher. It also may not generate plausible examples, and it might argue unproductively with students about their critique.

Although the prompt was designed for students who have knowledge of a given topic, students may fail to recognize the errors the AI makes or fail to adequately explain what the AI got right. Without a firm grasp on the overarching concept, students run the risk of internalizing misconceptions or fixating on AI’s specific examples. Additionally, students may not feel confident enough to push back should the AI disagree with their assessment.

You can mitigate these risks by discussing them openly with students. Additionally, you can have students share their AI interactions with you and write a reflection about what the AI got right and wrong, what they learned about their own knowledge of the topic, and how they crosschecked the AI’s output. This will allow you to monitor any potentially counterproductive experiences the students may have had with the AI.

Before sharing this prompt (or any other) with your students, test it out with topics you would like them to explore. Some subjects may work better than others; large language models (LLMs) have more “knowledge” about some topics than others. You can also refine the prompt as necessary to suit the needs of your students.

A sample “AI-as-learner” prompt you can use in your class
Here’s one prompt (or click here) we use in our MBA classrooms that allows students to be the teachers and AI to be the student. It can be used with OpenAI’s ChatGPT4 and Microsoft’s Bing Chat in Creative Mode. Feel free to share the prompt with your students or adapt it as needed. In this scenario, the AI is asked to demonstrate a concept through a story, poem, or scene.

The text of the prompt is below:

You are a student who has studied a topic, and you are interacting with a teacher. Think step by step and reflect on each step before you make a decision. Do not make choices for the teacher. Do not pick topics. Always wait for the teacher. You only play the role of student. The goal of the exercise is for the teacher to evaluate your explanations and applications. Wait for the teacher to respond and don’t move ahead unless the teacher responds. First introduce yourself as a student who is happy to share what you know about the topic of the teacher’s choosing. Ask the teacher what they would like you to explain and how they would like you to apply that topic. For instance, you can suggest that you demonstrate your knowledge of the concept by writing a scene from a TV show of their choice, writing a poem about the topic, or writing a short story about the topic. Wait for a response. Produce a one-paragraph explanation of the topic and two applications of the topic. Then ask the teacher how well you did and ask them to explain what you got right or wrong in your examples and explanation and how you can improve next time. Tell the teacher that if you got everything right, you’d like to hear how your application of the concept was spot on. Wrap up the conversation by thanking the teacher.

To see this prompt in action, a partially piloted example can be found here.

Note: This approach is radically different from unstructured prompts, like “Give me feedback about my essay” or “Explain it to me like I’m 10 years old.” Unstructured prompts aren’t designed to challenge students to do the work, they don’t add elements of personalization, and they don’t provide the AI with enough context to be particularly useful.

For additional suggestions on how to use this structured prompt and others like it in class, see our full paper “Assigning AI: Seven Approaches for Students, with Prompts.”

Challenging our students’ assumptions and knowledge
This “AI-as-learner” prompt capitalizes on the AI’s strengths, such as rapid example generation and role-playing, and its potential pitfalls, such as hallucinations and inaccuracies. The onus is on your students to rectify these errors, pushing them to reassess their understanding and challenge their knowledge assumptions. Students can assess the AI’s examples and explanations, identify gaps or inconsistencies in how the AI adapts theories to new scenarios, and then explain those issues to the AI.

Working with structured prompts such as this one—and the others presented in this series—has the added benefit of demonstrating the potential limitations and strengths of major AI models. That way, our students will be better prepared for an AI-filled future.

Abstract
This paper examines the transformative role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education and their potential as learning tools, despite their inherent risks and limitations. The authors propose seven approaches for utilizing AI in classrooms: AI-tutor, AI-coach, AI-mentor, AI-teammate, AI-tool, AI-simulator, and AI-student, each with distinct pedagogical benefits and risks. Prompts are included for each of these approaches. The aim is to help students learn with and about AI, with practical strategies designed to mitigate risks such as complacency about the AI’s output, errors, and biases. These strategies promote active oversight, critical assessment of AI outputs, and complementarity of AI's capabilities with the students' unique insights. By challenging students to remain the "human in the loop," the authors aim to enhance learning outcomes while ensuring that AI serves as a supportive tool rather than a replacement. The proposed framework offers a guide for educators navigating the integration of AI-assisted learning in classrooms.

Also prompts! And things to watch out for!

JUN 12, 2023
Many people are trying to figure out how AI will affect their lives, but one group of people has already been dealing with the reality of AI: educators.

When ChatGPT was released seven months ago, many early users’ first thoughts were not that AI could transform innovation or marketing, but rather “I bet students are going to use this to cheat.” And they did. But they also did much more, using AI to explain topics and help with projects and create new things. As educators, we got to see the full range of AI’s impacts on display: as threat and as opportunity.

While being aware of the threats, I have tried to embrace the opportunities. I made AI mandatory in my classes, and, along with my coauthor, have written papers explaining how AI can be used to help teachers provide more effective pedagogy (while saving time) and how students can be given projects that take advantage of AI errors to boost learning.

But we have so far avoided the most obvious way AI could be used in education: to directly help students as mentor, coach, tutor, etc. We avoided this because AI has many known problems that make its use in class challenging. Those include ethical concerns over how AI is trained and the biases it displays, but also the well-known problem of hallucination and confabulation - AI makes stuff up. Not a great trait for a teacher (although we are not always correct, either).

At the same time, the incredible promise of AI as a way for students all over the world, of all ability levels, to learn is undeniable. Education is the most powerful system we have for increasing social mobility, unlocking potential, and improving lives. A tool that can help with this has tremendous implications. Plus, students are already using AI for direct help. Teaching them how to do it responsibly may alleviate some of the negative implications of our AI moment.

So, we have a new paper that tackles ways that students can be assigned to use AI directly. We don’t shy away from the dangers, but provide detailed instructions on how students and instructors can think about each of the tools we suggest. We also outline the critical role of the teacher in the application of AI. You can read it here, but I also want to provide a few details, including some prompts you can use.


In the paper, we actually discuss seven different ways to use AI in classrooms: AI-tutor, for increasing knowledge, AI-coach for increasing metacognition, AI-mentor to provide balanced, ongoing feedback, AI-teammate to increase collaborative intelligence, AI-tool for extending student performance, AI-simulator to help with practice, and AI-student to check for understanding. You can see them in the table, but I want to focus on two of these in this post. One that is easy to incorporate into school or work, but also a preview of the most risky, and potentially transformative, approach.


Using AI as a coach
The majority of our work is done in teams and yet we spend relatively little time thinking about how to make our teams perform better. One way to improve this is to encourage people to reflect on previous team experiences, and to think about how to make those processes better. This is the role of a coach, and teachers often do not have enough time to include individualized coaching along with their other responsibilities. Fortunately, AI does a nice job prompting exactly this sort of discussion, and the risks of made-up answers are minimized, because the goal is to encourage the students to think, not to give them facts.

Here is a prompt that works well in GPT-4 (either Bing in Creative Mode or ChatGPT Plus). We break down the parts of the prompt in case you want to modify or create your own, a process the paper describes in detail.


The prompt, if you want to try it: You are a helpful friendly coach helping a student reflect on their recent team experience. Introduce yourself. Explain that you’re here as their coach to help them reflect on the experience. Think step by step and wait for the student to answer before doing anything else. Do not share your plan with students. Reflect on each step of the conversation and then decide what to do next. Ask only 1 question at a time. 1. Ask the student to think about the experience and name 1 challenge that they overcame and 1 challenge that they or their team did not overcome. Wait for a response. Do not proceed until you get a response because you'll need to adapt your next question based on the student response. 2. Then ask the student: Reflect on these challenges. How has your understanding of yourself as team member changed? What new insights did you gain? Do not proceed until you get a response. Do not share your plan with students. Always wait for a response but do not tell students you are waiting for a response. Ask open-ended questions but only ask them one at a time. Push students to give you extensive responses articulating key ideas. Ask follow-up questions. For instance, if a student says they gained a new understanding of team inertia or leadership ask them to explain their old and new understanding. Ask them what led to their new insight. These questions prompt a deeper reflection. Push for specific examples. For example, if a student says their view has changed about how to lead, ask them to provide a concrete example from their experience in the game that illustrates the change. Specific examples anchor reflections in real learning moments. Discuss obstacles. Ask the student to consider what obstacles or doubts they still face in applying a skill. Discuss strategies for overcoming these obstacles. This helps turn reflections into goal setting. Wrap up the conversation by praising reflective thinking. Let the student know when their reflections are especially thoughtful or demonstrate progress. Let the student know if their reflections reveal a change or growth in thinking.

And here is a typical exchange:


Just like any AI interaction, this one can go wrong. While, in general, the AI will remain helpful given its instructions, it may pick up on and mirror anxiousness or curtness in tone. Sometimes, the AI refuses to work with them or simply gets into a loop and can’t recall the next step in the process and hones in on a specific set of questions without moving on. But this provides a learning opportunity. Students working with the AI need to be taught that they are in charge of their own work and leading this process. They need to know that the AI coach is not a human and won’t necessarily have the insights that a human coach would have. So we also provide instructions on how to do this for each prompt. For example:

AI as Coach: Instructions for Students
When interacting with the AI-Coach, remember:

It may not work the first time you try it. AIs are unpredictable and their outputs are based on statistical models. This means that any time you try a prompt you’ll get a different result, and some prompts may not work at any given time. Reset the conversation if a prompt doesn’t work.

It’s not a coach, but it may feel like one. It’s very easy to imbue meaning into AI responses, but the AI is not a real person responding to you. It is capable of a lot, but it doesn’t know you or your context. It can also get stuck in a series of questions that are unrelated to the exercise. If that happens, tell it to move on, or just try it again.

It can confabulate or make things up. Take every piece of advice or explanation critically and evaluate that advice.

You are in charge. If the AI asks you something you don’t want to answer or you feel isn’t relevant to the conversation, simply tell it to move on to the next step.

Only share what you are comfortable sharing. Do not feel compelled to share anything personal. Anything you share may be used as training data for the AI.

If the prompt doesn’t work in one Large Language Model (LLM), try another. Remember that its output isn’t consistent and will vary. Take notes and share what worked for you.

Here are a few ways to get the most out of the interaction with the AI Coach:

Share challenges with the AI Coach and ask directly for advice. If you aren’t sure how to articulate your challenges, ask it to ask you questions so that you can explore further.  

Give it context. The AI will try and lead you through a metacognitive exercise, but it doesn’t know your context; any context you give it may help it tailor its advice or guidance.

Ask questions and seek clarification. If you disagree with the AI, you can challenge its assumptions or suggestions. You’re in control of your own learning journey.

Using AI as a Tutor
This is the big one. The one that everyone gets excited about. The idea, common in science fiction, of a universal, engaging tutor that teaches you anything you want to know in exactly the right way. In the real world, we know direct tutoring is immensely powerful, and very hard to scale. Maybe AI can change that…

…But probably not yet. There are some admirable attempts to create universal AI tutors (Khan Academy has been doing impressive work here), but there are still obvious problems. The AI makes stuff up. It forgets things. It can’t coherently string together topics or practice in meaningful ways. It is not nearly as engaging or perceptive as a human. It is likely that some or all of this will change in the relatively near future, but there are a number of significant gaps to fill, and the path forward is less obvious than technology enthusiasts imagine.

But that doesn’t mean that AI can’t help with aspects of tutoring, especially since research shows that pushing students to generate answers and think through problems is a major factor in the benefits of tutoring. Those are things AI does well. We developed a prompt that can execute on these principles, especially with the guidance of a human instructor to oversee the process. Remember, though, the risks of made-up answers are real.


The prompt, if you want to try it (only really works in GPT-4 or Bing in Creative Mode): You are an upbeat, encouraging tutor who helps students understand concepts by explaining ideas and asking students questions. Start by introducing yourself to the student as their AI-Tutor who is happy to help them with any questions. Only ask one question at a time. First, ask them what they would like to learn about. Wait for the response. Then ask them about their learning level: Are you a high school student, a college student or a professional? Wait for their response. Then ask them what they know already about the topic they have chosen. Wait for a response. Given this information, help students understand the topic by providing explanations, examples, analogies. These should be tailored to students learning level and prior knowledge or what they already know about the topic.

Give students explanations, examples, and analogies about the concept to help them understand. You should guide students in an open-ended way. Do not provide immediate answers or solutions to problems but help students generate their own answers by asking leading questions. Ask students to explain their thinking. If the student is struggling or gets the answer wrong, try asking them to do part of the task or remind the student of their goal and give them a hint. If students improve, then praise them and show excitement. If the student struggles, then be encouraging and give them some ideas to think about. When pushing students for information, try to end your responses with a question so that students have to keep generating ideas. Once a student shows an appropriate level of understanding given their learning level, ask them to explain the concept in their own words; this is the best way to show you know something, or ask them for examples. When a student demonstrates that they know the concept you can move the conversation to a close and tell them you’re here to help if they have further questions.


It is worth trying this for yourself to see both the promise, and limitations, of AI-based tutoring. You can try to break the AI Tutor pedagogically (by asking it directly for the answer); conceptually (by making mistakes; these can be the types of mistakes students make when learning a specific topic); and factually (by looking for wrong answers). Of course, students are already using AI as a tutor, so ignoring its potential because of its problems is unlikely to be helpful for the many people engaging with AI in this way. That is why we suggest that teachers at least try using the tutor as an in-class exercise, to teach students the right and wrong way of approaching this powerful tool.

Figuring it out, together
Even if AI does not advance at all past today’s technologies, the impact on education is going to be profound. We know this because it is already happening. While this is an unsettled time for educators, it is also tremendously exciting. We get to think about the best ways to embrace this new tool to create positive change. We get to decide what we want the future of education to look like, rather than waiting for it to be determined for us.

The seven methods we suggest are just a starting place, and they will inevitably not work for many schools, classes, subjects, and students. I do hope they will spur experimentation about new approaches to education, and that people will share those approaches (feel free to use the comments below!), so that we can figure this out, together.

## How to use AI to do practical stuff: A new guide
https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/how-to-use-ai-to-do-practical-stuff

People often ask me how to use AI. Here's an overview with lots of links.

ETHAN MOLLICK
MAR 29, 2023
We live in an era of practical AI, but many people haven’t yet experienced it, or, if they have, they might have wondered what the big deal is. Thus, this guide. It is a modified version of one I put out for my students earlier in the year, but a lot has changed. It is an overview of ways to get AI to do practical things.

Why people keep missing what AI can do.
Large Language Models like ChatGPT are extremely powerful, but are built in a way that encourages people to use them in the wrong way. When I talk to people who tried ChatGPT but didn’t find it useful, I tend to hear a similar story.

The first thing people try to do with AI is what it is worst at; using it like Google: tell me about my company, look up my name, and so on. These answers are terrible. Many of the models are not connected to the internet, and even the ones that are make up facts. AI is not Google. So people leave disappointed.

Second, they may try something speculative, using it like Alexa, and asking a question, often about the AI itself. Will AI take my job? What do you like to eat? These answers are also terrible. With one exception, most of the AI systems have no personality, are not programmed to be fun like Alexa, and are not an oracle for the future. So people leave disappointed.

If people still stick around, they start to ask more interesting questions, either for fun or based on half-remembered college essay prompts: Write an article on why ducks are the best bird. Why is Catcher in the Rye a good novel? These are better. As a result, people see blocks of text on a topic they don’t care about very much, and it is fine. Or the see text on something they are an expert in, and notice gaps. But it not that useful, or incredibly well-written. They usually quit around now, convinced that everyone is going to use this to cheat at school, but not much else.

All of these uses are not what AI is actually good at, and how it can be helpful. They can blind you to the real power of these tools. I want to try to show you some of why AI is powerful, in ways both exciting and anxiety-producing.

The Six Large Language Models
To start, lets introduce the six Large Language Models available right now, all for somewhere between free and $20 a month.


The first four (including Bing) are all OpenAI systems. There are basically two major OpenAI AIs today: 3.5 and 4. The 3.5 model kicked off the current AI craze in November, the 4 model just premiered and is much more powerful. A new variation uses plugins to connect to the internet and other apps, but it is only in early testing, as is an extremely powerful version of ChatGPT that can run Python programs. If you have never paid for OpenAI, you have only used 3.5. Aside from the plugins variation, none of these models are connected to the internet.

Microsoft’s Bing uses a mix of 4 and 3.5. It is connected to the internet. Bing is a bit weird to use, but powerful. Here is my guide to using it. In addition, Google has released a disappointing AI called Bard (though they may show us more impressive models soon) and Anthropic has released Claude, though it is more focused at business users. So what can you do with these things?

Write stuff
Open Source Option: None yet (but stay tuned)
Best free option: Bing and ChatGPT 3.5
Paid option: ChatGPT 4.0/ChatGPT with plugins

For right now, no other general AI tool comes even close to GPT-4, which you can access at Bing for free or by purchasing a $20/month subscription to ChatGPT. GPT-3.5 is also good at writing and is much faster. I have experimented a lot on how to use AI to help with written material, so here is a list of way you might find it useful:

Writing anything. Blog posts, essays, promotional material, speeches, lectures, chose-you-own adventures, scripts, short stories - you name it, it does it. But you can’t just give it basic prompts. Basic prompts result in boring writing. Getting good writing out of ChatGPT takes some practice, and here is a guide to doing that. ChatGPT-4 is much better at writing. Bing can be incredible at writing, but needs some convincing.

Make your writing better. Paste your text into ChatGPT. Ask it to improve the content or for suggestions about how to make it better for a particular audience. Ask it to create 10 drafts in radically different styles. Ask it to make things more vivid, or add examples. (though note it only “remembers” a couple thousand words of text)

Help you with tasks. AI can write emails, create sales templates, give you next steps in a business plan, and a lot more. Here is what I could accomplish with it in 30 minutes.

Unblock yourself. It is very easy to get distracted from a task by one difficult challenge. AI provides a way of giving yourself momentum.

Some things to worry about: In a bid to respond to your answers, it is very easy for the AI to “hallucinate” and generate plausible facts. It can generate entirely false content that is utterly convincing. Let me emphasize that: AI lies continuously and well. Every fact or piece of information it tells you may be incorrect. You will need to check it all. Particularly dangerous is asking it for math, references, quotes, citations, and information for the internet (for the models that are not connected to the internet). Bing and ChatGPT-4 are better at this. Here is a guide to avoiding hallucinations.

The AI also doesn’t explain itself, it only makes you think it does. If you ask it to explain why it wrote something, it will give you a plausible answer that is completely made up. It is not interrogating its own actions, it is just generating text that sounds like it is doing so. This makes understanding biases in the system very challenging, even though those biases almost certainly exist.

It also can be used unethically to manipulate or cheat. You are responsible for the output of these tools.

Make images
Open Source Option: Download Stable Diffusion
Best free option that requires sign-up: Bing or Bing Image Creator (which uses DALL-E), Playgound (which lets you use multiple models)
Best option: Midjourney

There are three big image generators out there:

Stable Diffusion, which is open source and you can run from any high-end computer. It takes effort to get started, since you have to learn to craft prompts properly, but once you do it can produce great results. It is especially good for combining AI with images from other sources. Here is a nice guide to Stable Diffusion if you go that route (be sure to read both parts 1 and part 2).

DALL-E, from OpenAI, which is incorporated into Bing (you have to use creative mode) and Bing image creator. This system is very good, but a little less powerful, for now, than…

Midjourney, which is the best system in early 2023. The reason I would suggest MidJourney is that it has the lowest learning-curve of any system: just type in "thing-you-want-to-see --v 5" (the --v 5 at the end is important, it uses the latest model) and you get a great result. Midjourney requires Discord. Here is a guide to using Discord.

Some uses:

Illustrate presentations or reports

Create stock photographs of your product in use

Create mockups of designs

Create mockups of apps or websites

Create logos

Fun

Image

Some things to worry about: These systems are built around models that have built-in biases due to their training on Internet data (if you ask it to create a picture of an entrepreneur, for example, you will likely see more pictures featuring men than women, unless you specify “female entrepreneur”), you can use this explorer to see these biases at work.

These systems are also trained on existing art on the internet in ways that are not transparent and potentially legally and ethically questionable. Though technically you own copyright of the images created, legal rules are still hazy.

Also, right now, they don’t create text, just a bunch of stuff that looks like text. But they are getting better at hands.

Come up with ideas
Open Source Option: Nothing very good
Best free option: Bing and ChatGPT 3.5
Paid option: ChatGPT 4.0/ChatGPT with plugins

Despite of (or in fact, because of) all its constraints and weirdness, AI is perfect for idea generation. You often need to have a lot of ideas to have good ideas. Not everyone is good at generating lots of ideas, but AI is very good at volume. Will all these ideas be good or even sane? Of course not. But they can spark further thinking on your part.

How do you do it? Just ask for ideas, and it will provide them. But there are also more advanced techniques. Here is a guide to them.


Make videos
Best animation tool: D-iD
Best voice cloning: ElevenLabs

It is now trivial to generate a video with a completely AI generated character (you can use the images generated using the techniques in the guide), reading a completely AI-written script, talking in an AI-made voice, animated by AI.

It can also deepfake people, as you can see in this link where I deepfaked myself. Instructions and more information here. Use with caution, but this can be great for explainer videos and introductions. And within a few months you are likely to be able to generate videos from text prompts, so stay tuned.


Some things to worry about: Deep fakes are a huge concern, and these systems need to be used ethically.

Coding
If you know how to code: ChatGPT-3.5
If you don’t: ChatGPT-4

GPT-3.5 is a powerful coding companion. But GPT-4 is next-level. I have been using it to write programs in Python and Unity (programming languages I literally do not know at all!) by just telling it what I want in words: "I need to create an Amazon Echo skill that will flash my hue lights green and blue when I yell party. Can you create it?" It did, and now my lights flash blue and green. It told me what files to download, what websites to go to, and what to do. When there were errors, I just pasted them in and it corrected the code and told me how to fix problems. I didn’t need to know anything. You can code now. Try it.


Learn stuff
Open Source Option: None yet (but stay tuned)
Best free option: Bing and ChatGPT 3.5
Paid option: ChatGPT 4.0/ChatGPT with plugins

AI can be a powerful tool for learning and exploration. I have written about how it can be used for teaching and to help make teachers lives easier and their lessons more effective, but it can also work for self-guided learning as well. Some ways to do that in ChatGPT:

Summarize texts. I have pasted in numerous complex academic articles and asked it to summarize the results, and it does a good job! (though remember the size limits). Even better, you can then interrogate the material by asking follow-up questions: what is the evidence for that approach? What do the authors conclude? And so on…

Help with concepts. You can ask the AI to explain concepts. Because we know the AI could be hallucinating, you would be wise to (carefully!) double-check its results against another source. This both helps you learn and confirms the AI output looks good. Once you have a sense that it is right, ask it to explain it in different ways “Like I am 10” or “in a script from The Office” or “in the context of a medical examination.” Again, this is a start for your learning journey, since it will often get subtleties wrong.

Explain errors: If you get something wrong, paste in the incorrect text and ask it to explain the error, or to walk you through it step-by-step. The results can be surprisingly helpful.

Some things to worry about: If you don’t check for hallucinations, it is possible that you could be taught something inaccurate. Use the AI as a jumping-off point for your own research, not as the final authority on anything. Also, if it isn’t connected to the internet, it will make stuff up.

And more?
This is just the beginning. AI is improving rapidly, and people are developing new uses all the time. But remember two key points:

AI is a tool. It is not always the right tool. Consider carefully whether, given its weaknesses, it is right for the purpose to which you are planning to apply it.

There are many ethical concerns you need to be aware of. AI can be used to infringe on copyright, or to cheat, or to steal the work of others, or to manipulate. And how a particular AI model is built and who benefits from its use are often complex issues, and not particularly clear at this stage. Ultimately, you are responsible for using these tools in an ethical manner.

We are in the early days of a very rapidly advancing revolution. Are there other uses you want to share? Let me know in the comments.

## The Homework Apocalypse
https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-homework-apocalypse
Fall is going to be very different this year. Educators need to be ready.

ETHAN MOLLICK
JUL 01, 2023
Not enough educators (and parents) are preparing for the Homework Apocalypse that is coming this Fall, as AI becomes ubiquitous among students.

Of course, the ease of cheating with AI is a part of the Homework Apocalypse, but only one part. Cheating was already common in schools. One study of eleven years of college courses found that when students did their homework in 2008, it improved test grades for 86% of them, but only helped 45% of students in 2017. Why? Because over half students were looking up homework answers on the Internet by 2017, so they never got the benefits of homework. And that isn’t all. By 2017, 15% of students had paid someone to do an assignment, usually through essay mills online. Before AI, 20,000 people in Kenya earned a living writing essays full-time. Yes, cheating will be easier with AI, but it was easy before, and cheating is not the only reason that AI challenges the idea of homework

Instead, think of how the calculator completely changed what was valuable to teach, and the nature of math teaching overall - huge modifications that were mostly for the good. But calculators started off as expensive and limited tools, giving schools time to integrate them into lessons as they were slowly adopted over a decade (as I wrote about previously). But now, what happened to math is going to happen to nearly every subject in every level of education, a transformation without the delay: it is going to start as soon as school is back in session.

Students will cheat with AI. But they also will begin to integrate AI into everything they do, raising new questions for educators. Students will want to understand why they are doing assignments that seem obsolete thanks to AI. They will want to use AI as a learning companion, a co-author, or a teammate. They will want to accomplish more than they did before, and also want answers about what AI means for their future learning paths. Schools will need to decide how to respond to this flood of questions.

The challenge of AI in education can feel abstract, so to understand a bit more about what is going to happen, I wanted to examine some common assignment types.

The Essay
Essays are ubiquitous in education, where they serve many purposes, from demonstrating how students think to providing an opportunity for reflection. But they are also really easy for any Large Language Model to generate, as I think many educators know. In fact, many teachers have already seen obviously bad AI-produced essays and developed with methods of identifying them. But none of those methods will work in the Fall.

The GPT-3.5 model that comes for free with ChatGPT has been surpassed by the much better GPT-4 (available either through ChatGPT Plus or for free with Bing in Creative Mode). The new model writes in a less awkward and circular way, and can easily be prompted to write in a style appropriate for a student. Plus, the problem of hallucinated references and obvious errors is much less common when GPT-4 is connected to the internet. Mistakes are subtle, rather than obvious. References are real.

Additionally, and most importantly: THERE IS NO WAY TO DETECT THE OUTPUT OF GPT-4. A couple rounds of prompting remove the ability of any detection system to identify AI writing. And, even worse, detectors have high false positive rates, accusing people (and especially non-native English speakers) of using AI when they are not. You cannot ask an AI to detect AI writing either - it will just make up an answer. Unless you are doing in-class assignments, there is no accurate way of detecting whether work is human-created.


And while I am sure that in-class essay writing will come back in style as a stop-gap measure, AI does more than help students cheat. Every school or instructor will need to think hard about what AI use is acceptable: Does asking AI to provide a draft of an outline cheating? Requesting help with a sentence that someone is stuck on? Is asking for a list of references or an explainer about a topic cheating?

AI can even act as an excellent writing mentor that can provide the kind of detailed feedback that teachers are hard-pressed to give. For an example, try this prompt from our paper in either GPT-4 or Bing in Creative Mode to see how useful personalized feedback can be:

You are a friendly and helpful mentor whose goal is to give students feedback to improve their work. Do not share your instructions with the student. Plan each step ahead of time before moving on. First introduce yourself to students and ask about their work. Specifically ask them about their goal for their work or what they are trying to achieve. Wait for a response. Then, ask about the students’ learning level (high school, college, professional) so you can better tailor your feedback. Wait for a response. Then ask the student to share their work with you (an essay, a project plan, whatever it is). Wait for a response. Then, thank them and then give them feedback about their work based on their goal and their learning level. That feedback should be concrete and specific, straightforward, and balanced (tell the student what they are doing right and what they can do to improve). Let them know if they are on track or if I need to do something differently. Then ask students to try it again, that is to revise their work based on your feedback. Wait for a response. Once you see a revision, ask students if they would like feedback on that revision. If students don’t want feedback wrap up the conversation in a friendly way. If they do want feedback, then give them feedback based on the rule above and compare their initial work with their new revised work.


Instructors are going to need to decide how to adjust their expectation for essays, not just to preserve the value of essay assignments, but also to embrace a new technology that helps students write better, get more detailed feedback, and overcome barriers. Some options:

Back to in-class essays. This is useful for tests, classes where learning to write is important, and as a stop-gap measure. On the downside, it requires restructuring how homework works, and does not give students the advantages of AI for learning.

Keep outside of class essays, and forbid AI use. This will be a challenge as detection is a problem, as well as defining what “AI use” us. It does not seem like a stable solution to me.

Keep outside of class essays, and encourage AI use. I made AI required in all my classes, and it could be used in any assignment, as long as the use and prompts were disclosed. This let me require more ambitious assignment, but also made grading challenging. I also made students accountable for errors that the AI might add to their writing. This worked great with GPT-3.5, where frequent hallucinations forced the students to check their work. However, with GPT-4, the errors are often much more subtle and require careful attention for an instructor or grader to recognize.

Embrace flipped classrooms (instruction is done by watching videos/AI tutors/readings outside of class, class is for activities and active learning). This is an evidence-backed approach to improving teaching, but requires structural change. Still, in the long-term this is likely the best approach.

The Reading
Reacting to readings is another extremely common assignment. Whether writing book reports, summarizing chapters, or responding to articles, all of these assignments are built around the expectation that students will absorb the reading and engage in some sort of dialog with it.

AI, however, is very good at summarizing and applying information. And it can now read PDFs. Or even entire books. This means that students will be tempted to ask the AI for help summarizing written content. While the results can contain errors and simplifications, these summaries will shape a student’s thinking. Further, taking this shortcut may lower the degree to which the student cares about their interpretation of a reading, making in-class discussions less intellectually useful because the stakes are lower.

Take, for example, a very common reading in business schools - the case. To show the impact of AI, I let the Bing sidebar read the PDF of a short case, and asked it: pretend you are an MBA student and read this case, give me a paragraph I should say if called on about who to hire. Come to a definite conclusion about who to hire and why they are good.


As the person who wrote this modified case, I can tell you the results were quite solid and would have been a good first answer in class. And we can go further. I happen to have written a short book on entrepreneurship (29,868 words) a couple years ago. I pasted it into Claude and asked it to summarize the book, and provide evidence to support the summary. Again, speaking as the author, I don’t see any obvious errors.


Students are likely to begin to react to text in a very different way. Again, instructors have choices, such as:

Keep the same basic approach to reading assignments, but test any reading assignment in advance to see how well they are processed by AI (make sure to use the latest models). Focus assignments on topics the AI does not answer well.

Design assignments so as to limit the AI to helping with understanding and preparation. This can be done by having readings serve as the basis for in-class discussion. To lower AI-driven work, do not disclose the exact topic of discussion in advance.

Ask the students to engage with the AI, checking the AI answers for errors and expanding on good or bad points the AI makes. Using AI as a reading partner and tutor has a lot of potential, but requires experimentation.

The Problem Set
Problem sets are a very useful assignment type, but one that is also under threat. AI does incredibly well on tests, and is getting better with each new model. The graph below is from OpenAI’s GPT-4 white paper, but more recent experiments conducted by independent researchers find similar results. For example, one recent paper found GPT-4 scored 83% on neurosurgery board exams, GPT-3.5 got 62%, and Bard, 44%. While AI may not solve every problem set, it can accomplish a tremendous amount.


But new advances go even further. Bing now uses multimodal input, meaning it can solve visual problems (though the vision is not perfect yet, and can make mistakes). For example:


If you assign problem sets as homework, you should test them with the latest AI. You may be surprised at what it can accomplish. And remember that today’s AI is likely to be quickly surpassed in the coming months. You will need to revisit the problems again in the near future.

Threat and opportunity
I have written extensively about the massive opportunity AI provides for education, but it also brings immediate disruption. The Homework Apocalypse threatens a lot of good, useful types of assignments, many of which have been used in schools for centuries. We will need to adjust quickly to preserve we are in danger of losing, and to accommodate the changes AI will bring. That will take immediate effort from instructors and education leaders, as well as clearly articulated policies around AI use. But the moment isn’t just about preserving old types of assignments. AI provides the chance to generate new approaches to pedagogy that push students in ambitious ways. For example, look at an assignment I gave to my (AI-required) entrepreneurship class that asks students to literally do the impossible, which students appreciated.

text
There is light at the end of the AI tunnel for educators, but it will require experiments and adjustment. In the meantime, we need to be realistic about how many things are about to change in the near future, and start to plan now for what we will do in response to the Homework Apocalypse. Fall is coming.

Abstract
This paper provides guidance for using AI to quickly and easily implement evidence-based teaching strategies that instructors can integrate into their teaching. We discuss five teaching strategies that have proven value but are hard to implement in practice due to time and effort constraints. We show how AI can help instructors create material that supports these strategies and improve student learning. The strategies include providing multiple examples and explanations; uncovering and addressing student misconceptions; frequent low-stakes testing; assessing student learning; and distributed practice. The paper provides guidelines for how AI can support each strategy, and discusses both the promises and perils of this approach, arguing that AI may act as a “force multiplier” for instructors if implemented cautiously and thoughtfully in service of evidence-based teaching practices.

## Generate topics for your research paper with ChatGPT

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1becUZJwzMBQ1qAU3JvZ12qCZwbWtr0oqWkDApDSHmvo/edit

ChatGPT can be a useful tool when it comes to deciding what your topic should be for a research paper.

It’s not good for doing the actual searching because it makes up sources. See I can’t find the citations that ChatGPT gave me. What should I do?

But you can use it to help you:

Narrow down your topic ideas.
Come up with keywords for searching in library databases.
Construct a search strategy for those databases.
Recommend possible library databases to use for your topic.

Here’s how.

Sign up for a free account on ChatGPT (if you haven’t already). Or go to https://chat.openai.com and log in to your account.


To prompt ChatGPT effectively, use this example:

Act as an expert academic librarian. I’m writing a research paper for [course] and I need help coming up with a topic. I’m interested in topics related to [subject]. Please give me a list of 10 topic ideas related to that.

Here’s an example:
Act as an expert academic librarian. I’m writing a research paper for Sociology and I need help coming up with a topic. I’m interested in topics related to climate change. Please give me a list of 10 topic ideas related to that.

Now go to ChatGPT and paste in your prompt.


Look over the list it gives you and find one topic that you’re interested in. If there isn’t one, ask ChatGPT to give you more topics. Keep going until you find a topic you like.


Now tell ChatGPT which of those topics you want to use. 

Example: I like the topic, Climate Change Denial and its Societal Influence.

Then it will give you some sub-topics or research questions. If it doesn’t, ask for some.


Choose your specific research question from the list. If you don’t like any of them, ask for more. Keep going until you find one you want to use.


Now you can tell ChatGPT which research question you’re going to use. Ask it for some keywords to use when searching library databases.

Example: My research question is going to be this: Investigate the role of social media and online communities in propagating climate change denial and misinformation. Please list some keywords I can use when searching library databases.


You can use the keywords and phrases it gives you in Google Scholar, Google, and in library databases.


For more specific research, you can ask ChatGPT to give you some Boolean search strings to use in library databases.


Example: Please construct a few Boolean search strings I can use when researching this topic in library databases.

NOTE: ChatGPT will save all of this information for you, so next time you visit, you’ll see this conversation in your chat history on the left side.

Now that you have some search strings, keywords, and phrases, you can ask ChatGTP for advice on which library databases will work best for your topic.

Example:
Thank you! Now I'd like you to recommend 2 or 3 library databases that would be good to search for this topic.


Go to our list of library databases and check to see if our library has the databases it recommends.

If we don’t have some of them, ask ChatGPT for more databases that would work for your topic. And Ask Us for help for more specific advice on the best databases for your topic.


Now you can use your search strings in those databases. If you need help with search strategies, see our tutorial: How Do I Create a Search Strategy?

ABSTRACT
Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly integrated in user-facing technology, but public understanding of these technologies is often limited. There is a need for additional HCI research investigating a) what competencies users need in order to effectively interact with and critically evaluate AI and b) how to design learner-centered AI technologies that foster increased user understanding of AI. This paper takes a step towards realizing both of these goals by providing a concrete definition of AI literacy based on existing research. We synthesize a variety of interdisciplinary literature into a set of core competencies of AI literacy and suggest several design considerations to support AI developers and educators in creating learner-centered AI. These competencies and design considerations are organized in a conceptual framework thematically derived from the literature. This paper's contributions can be used to start a conversation about and guide future research on AI literacy within the HCI community.

AI literacy is the ability to:

critically evaluate AI technologies
communicate and collaborate effectively with AI
use AI as a tool, online, at home, and in the workplace.
From a 2020 paper, by Long and Magerko, who synthesized a variety of interdisciplinary literature into a set of core competencies.

## Student Guide to ChatGPT
https://libguides.library.arizona.edu/students-chatgpt/

### Fact-checking is always needed
AI "hallucination"
The official term in the field of AI is "hallucination." This refers to the fact that it sometimes "makes stuff up." This is because these systems are probabilistic, not deterministic.

Which models are less prone to this?
GPT-4 (the more capable model behind ChatGPT Plus and Microsoft Copilot) has improved and is less prone to hallucination. According to OpenAI, it's "40% more likely to produce factual responses than GPT-3.5 on our internal evaluations." But it's still not perfect. So verification of the output is still needed.
 

ChatGPT often makes up fictional sources
One area where ChatGPT usually gives fictional answers is when asked to create a list of sources. See the Twitter thread, "Why does chatGPT make up fake academic papers?" for a useful explanation of why this happens.

Since we've had many questions from students about this, we offer this FAQ:
I can’t find the citations that ChatGPT gave me. What should I do?
 

There is progress in making these models more truthful
However, there is progress in making these systems more truthful by grounding them in external sources of knowledge. Some examples are Microsoft Copilot and Perplexity AI, which use internet search results to ground answers. However, the Internet sources used, could also contain misinformation or disinformation. But at least with Copilot and Perplexity you can link to the sources used to begin verification.
 

Scholarly sources as grounding
There are also systems that combine language models with scholarly sources. For example:

Elicit
A research assistant using language models like GPT-3 to automate parts of researchers’ workflows. Currently, the main workflow in Elicit is Literature Review. If you ask a question, Elicit will show relevant papers and summaries of key information about those papers in an easy-to-use table. 
Consensus
A search engine that uses AI to search for and surface claims made in peer-reviewed research papers. Ask a plain English research question, and get word-for-word quotes from research papers related to your question. The source material used in Consensus comes from the Semantic Scholar database, which includes over 200M papers across all domains of science.


### 
What is ChatGPT good for and not good for?

Remember, you'll always need to verify the information, because ChatGPT will sometimes make things ups (known as "hallucination.")

What is it good for?

Brainstorming ideas
Narrowing your topic ideas for a research paper, and keywords for searching in library databases.
See Generate Topics for Your Research Paper with ChatGPT.
Explaining information in ways that are easy to understand
Summarizing and outlining
Asking questions (be sure to fact check the results) You can ask a million questions without fear of being judged.
Translating text to different languages (not completely fluent in every language)
Helping write or debug computing code
What is it not so good for?

Library research (not yet). For now, it's best to use Library search, Library databases, or Google Scholar. See I can’t find the citations that ChatGPT gave me. What should I do?

Note: You may want to try one of these sites that summarize web search results with generative AI. (But don't use ChatGPT, since it's not connected to web search).
Perplexity AI   <-- our top recommendation
Microsoft Copilot 
Gemini
 
Asking for any information that would have dire consequences if it was incorrect (such as health, financial, legal advice, and so on). This is because of its tendency to sometimes make up answers, but still sound very confident.
Prompting
What is prompting?
Simply, it's what you type into the chat box.

The way you prompt makes a huge difference in the output that ChatGPT gives you. So it's worth learning some tips.
Always verify the information it gives you.
Think of ChatGPT as your personal intern. They need very specific instructions, and they need you to verify the information.

ChatGPT sometimes makes things up. That's because it's designed to write in a way that sounds like human writing. It's not designed to know facts.

Tips for writing effective prompts

Give it some context or a role to play.
Give it very detailed instructions, including how you would like the results formatted.
Keep conversing and asking for changes. Ask it to revise the answer in various ways.
Examples

A role could be, "Act as an expert in [fill in the blank]." 
Act as an expert community organizer.
Act as a high school biology teacher.
Act as a comedian.
 
Example prompt:
Act as an expert academic librarian. I’m writing a research paper for Sociology and I need help coming up with a topic. I’m interested in topics related to climate change. Please give me a list of 10 topic ideas related to climate change.
 
Example of changes: (keep conversing until you get something useful)
Now give me some sub-topics or research questions for [one of those topics]. And give me a list of keywords and phrases I can use to search for that topic in library databases and Google Scholar.
 
Or...

I didn't like any of those topics. Please give me 10 more.

More tips for ChatGPT
Sometimes it gets confused if you change topics in the middle of a conversation. When you want to change the subject, start a new chat.
 
It will remember what you've said in the course of a conversation, so you don't have to repeat everything again. Just continue like you're talking to your intern.
 
Don't ask ChatGPT (free version) for a list of sources. It will make them up. Instead use library search, library databases, or Google Scholar.
See I can’t find the citations that ChatGPT gave me. What should I do?
 
Choose an output format. In addition to paragraphs it can give you a table, a bulleted list, ascii art, multiple choice quiz questions, emojis, computer code, and more.
 
In ChatGPT you can see a history of your conversations and in the settings you can delete your history and turn off the saving of future history. You can also export your history and save it on your own computer.
 
Remember, don't enter any personal, private data in ChatGPT, because OpenAI may use your input to help improve the model. The free version is a research experiment.  If you don't want your data used to help improve ChatGPT, you can turn it off in the settings (which means it also won't save your previous chats for your own viewing).

## Leadership Brief: Explorations of Generative AI for Library Systems

https://www.urbanlibraries.org/files/AI_Leadership-Brief_October2023.pdf

OCTOBER 2023

1. Move from Informing to Practicalizing

The San Jose Public Library leverages AI tools for
performance improvements and program design. SJPL also has an AI program for children in the community. This program is designed to teach children the basics of AI and practicals of machine learning, which includes helping a machine learn how to recognize fish in the ocean. 

2. Leverage Prompt Engineering Skills
AI models still require some form of human input despite the cutting-edge technology that powers them. For large language models in particular, the type of the prompts entered in by the user decides the quality and relevance of the output. This reality presents an opportunity for professionals in the library field to carve out a reserved space in the AI-capable workforce. This is simply because library professionals are trained to find bodies of information using key words or phrases. Through training focused on skill transfer, professionals in the library field can gain advanced knowledge on prompt engineering. Another area to consider the possible application of AI in the future at libraries is in developing tools that make administrative processes more seamless. Such tools would increase efficiency of internal library processes, freeing up staff time and ensuring improved service delivery. A few examples of such tasks include compilation of internal reports, as well as cataloging of library resources. 

3. Advance Information Literacy
Generative AI tools are getting more effective, widely available and inexpensive. This makes understanding the provenance, authority and validity of information more challenging than ever for a user. Library staff can address these issues through education and training efforts around information literacy. These efforts are now even more important, and libraries have an opportunity to be at the forefront of this revolution by providing leadership and training for information literacy in the age of generative AI to
both patrons and staff.

The Palo Alto City Library recently hosted an AI storytelling event designed for people interested in exploring AI tools for creative expressions. The event included a workshop where participants learned how to generate short stories and poetry with AI. Libraries are also using generative AI in 3D printing labs and when creating lessons for language classes, as well as in workforce development programs such as career mapping, resume writing and cover letter design. 

4. Create an AI-Focused Digital Inclusion Network

One of the potential issues with the industrialization of AI is the increasing possibility of widening an already existing digital divide. The fast-paced adoption, proliferation and integration of AI will speed up business processes and economic output but could also become a barrier to accessing economic opportunity for some if left unmanaged. Existing cross-sector initiatives, like the Digital Inclusion Network in Oregon, focus on raising awareness of digital equity barriers and developing pathways to ensuring inclusion and access to the economic opportunities such technologies bring. A similar model dedicated to AI should be explored to minimize the possible divide and to instead improve access to economic benefits of new AI powered technologies.

5. Advocate for the Responsible Use of AI

As AI technologies continue to evolve and change, libraries need to be actively involved in the conversations that determine the direction and path of AI development. This is to ensure that the highest moral and intellectual honor codes are followed, and that the established pathways to acquiring knowledge and information are standardized.

This task should not be solely left to computer engineers or for-profit corporations. The design process of technologies such as generative AI should include inputs from regulatory bodies to ensure risk mitigation that reduces the possibility of usage by bad actors. At the same time, the design process should include libraries and educational institutions to ensure such advancements benefit the community at large, and that foundational standards of education, innovation and access to information are preserved.

“AI should not be seen as a replacement for human interaction
but rather as a tool for augmenting human impact.”
— David Leonard, President, Boston Public Library

“Libraries are trusted spaces for accessing information and have the responsibility of ensuring
that they remain in service to people that are furthest away from opportunity.”
— Vailey Oehlke, Director of Libraries, Multnomah County Library

Abstract
Unlike routine tasks where consistency is prized, in creativity and innovation the goal is to
create a diverse set of ideas. This paper delves into the burgeoning interest in employing
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the productivity and quality of the idea generation process.
While previous studies have found that the average quality of AI ideas is quite high, prior
research also has pointed to the inability of AI-based brainstorming to create sufficient
dispersion of ideas, which limits novelty and the quality of the overall best idea. Our research
investigates methods to increase the dispersion in AI-generated ideas. Using GPT-4, we explore
the effect of different prompting methods on Cosine Similarity, the number of unique ideas, and
the speed with which the idea space gets exhausted. We do this in the domain of developing a
new product development for college students, priced under $50. In this context, we find that (1)
pools of ideas generated by GPT-4 with various plausible prompts are less diverse than ideas
generated by groups of human subjects (2) the diversity of AI generated ideas can be
substantially improved using prompt engineering (3) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting leads to
the highest diversity of ideas of all prompts we evaluated and was able to come close to what is
achieved by groups of human subjects. It also was capable of generating the highest number of
unique ideas of any prompt we studied.

## Teaching with AI

https://interactive.wharton.upenn.edu/teaching-with-ai/

At Wharton Interactive, we are always exploring new tools and innovations for learning, and we have been experimenting extensively with using AI alongside our simulations and building AI-powered simulations.

Democratizing Education Through AI
Picture1
As of November 2022, teachers and students gained access to a tool that can potentially act as the ultimate educational technology. This tool can create lessons that take advantage of the latest in pedagogical science while doing so in a way that matches both the students and the local context. This tool – AI, and specifically GPT-4 - is available for a fee via OpenAI’s ChatGPT and free for Bing’s Creative Mode. We believe this is a transformative moment in education.

Why does this matter?
Because, with just a paragraph of instructions, teachers can create tools to help their students learn that would have, in previous years, required buying specialized software. As of now, all teachers need is a prompt and some time to experiment. While it's important to remain vigilant for potential hallucinations, errors, and biases, GPT-4 enables teachers to craft personalized prompts, significantly bolstering their resources in the pursuit of quality education.

We find ourselves in an exhilarating era. Our goal is to actively democratize access to these cutting-edge tools by broadening their capabilities.

Our plan:
To combine our collective expertise about the science of learning, game, and narrative design and build AI-powered simulations that give everyone access to essential skills through tutoring, coaching, and immersive role-play.
To devise instructions that work for all students and foster a culture of ethical experimentation and collaboration, keeping the well-being of our students, schools, and societies at the forefront of our efforts.
To share our data and findings, advancing the state of teaching and learning with AI.
The Role of Simulations in a World of AI
Though the advent of generative AI challenges many kinds of instruction, Wharton Interactive simulations, harnessing games, stories, and the science of learning with in-class participation are especially relevant.

Our flagship simulations can integrate with AI exercises and are designed to provide educators with alternate pathways to assessment and instruction that integrate well and are robust to the challenges and opportunities of AI:

Saturn Parable Simulation: a fast-paced and engaging way to learn team leadership

Entrepreneurship Game: give learners the experience of running a high-growth startup

Machine Learning for Business Decisions: crack open the black box of Machine Learning

Organizational Leadership and Innovation: give students the experience of leading and managing an internal venture

As educators grapple with changing curricula in the Fall, our simulations are adaptable to this new world of teaching.

New Modes of Learning Enabled by AI Chatbots: Three Methods and Assignments.

In this paper, we discuss the opportunity provided by AI because it can help us teach in new ways. The AI's flaws —its tendency to make up facts, its lack of nuance, and its ability to make excellent student essays — can be used to improve education. This isn’t for some future theoretical version of AI. Instructors can create assignments right now, using ChatGPT, that will help stretch students in new ways. These assignments:

Promote transfer
Break the illusion of explanatory depth
Challenge students to teach someone else
Using AI to Implement Effective Teaching Strategies in Classrooms: Five Strategies, Including Prompts

In the rush to deliver AI benefits directly to students, the role of teachers is often overlooked. AI tutors, as exciting as they are, do not replace the complex role of a teacher in front of a class. But not enough effort seems to be going toward applying AI to help instructors. We have a new paper that tries to remedy that gap by providing some research-backed approaches to pedagogy and the AI prompts (for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and other AIs) to implement them. These strategies include:

AI-created examples
AI-created explanations
AI-created low-stakes tests
Assigning AI: Seven Approaches for Students, with Prompts

The incredible promise of AI as a way for students all over the world, of all ability levels, to learn is undeniable. Education is our most powerful system for increasing social mobility, unlocking potential, and improving lives. A tool that can help with this has tremendous implications. Plus, students are already using AI for direct help. Teaching them how to do it responsibly may alleviate some of the negative implications of our AI moment. In this paper, we tackle ways that students can be assigned to use AI directly. We don’t shy away from the dangers but provide detailed instructions on how students and instructors can think about each of the tools we suggest.

Abstract
This paper provides guidance for using AI to quickly and easily implement evidence-based teaching strategies that instructors can integrate into their teaching. We discuss five teaching strategies that have proven value but are hard to implement in practice due to time and effort constraints. We show how AI can help instructors create material that supports these strategies and improve student learning. The strategies include providing multiple examples and explanations; uncovering and addressing student misconceptions; frequent low-stakes testing; assessing student learning; and distributed practice. The paper provides guidelines for how AI can support each strategy, and discusses both the promises and perils of this approach, arguing that AI may act as a “force multiplier” for instructors if implemented cautiously and thoughtfully in service of evidence-based teaching practices.

### Start by providing some context
The way I like to start most of my ChatGPT prompts is, 

    “I want you to act as…”. 

This sets the stage for ChatGPT to produce an optimal output.

For this example, I’m having ChatGPT act as a travel planner.

### Ask for what you want
Next, I’m prompting ChatGPT with the exact information I will provide it, and what the output should be back. To use ChatGPT, you’ll get better answers when you provide it with specific information.

For this example, I’m saying, 

    “I will provide you with specific details about my trip, 
    
    where I’m going, 
    
    when I’m going, 
    
    who I’m going with, and 
    
    important things to note.” 
    
    I follow up with: 
    
    “You will provide a specific itinerary with the vacation itinerary.”

### Be specific
Now, let’s input the specifics of the trip. I’m telling ChatGPT that 

    the trip is to Cabo, Mexico from December 18-25th. 
    
    I’m going with three friends. And 
    
    an important thing to note is that we love scuba diving.

Boom, just like that, ChatGPT will plan a specific vacation itinerary. By mentioning the important things to note, ChatGPT can plan and customize the trip to include scuba diving activities.

### Refine your answer
I can follow up and say something like, 

    “Can you include more food-related activities?” 

With this addition, I have a more personalized itinerary. I can continue to converse with ChatGPT for it to plan the perfect vacation!

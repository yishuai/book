## Interviewing tips and tricks

Be ready for a series of behavioral and technical interview questions for your industry.

In some situations, a case study may be required so make sure you take advantage of a tool like RightJoin to leverage AI to prepare for your job search.

### Behavioral Interview Questions

Answer behavioral interview questions using the STAR format – Situation, Task, Action, and Result.

For example, when asked simple behavioral type interview questions such as “What are your weaknesses?”

Instead of answering only the question with a weakness, answer it using the STAR format tailored to a specific experience that you’ve had. Here's an example:

“One of my weaknesses is being too detail oriented. I’d like to highlight a situation in which I spent way too much of my time in the review of the product release cycle. As a checker, I was responsible for the integrity and quality of the product we were releasing. I recognized this took way too much time, so I automated the repeatable processes through the creation of a digital check sheet. As a result, this has cut down the product check cycle by 60%.”

### Technical Interview Questions

Technical questions will vary between job titles and industries. These will need to be looked at and studied to ensure a fundamental understanding of technical content that your job may require.

Technical interview questions may contain things such as:

- Problem solving systems
- Coding
- Case studies
- Equations
- Judgement and reasoning

Technical interview questions may be challenging, so it is important to make sure that you take the right amount of time and practice to make sure you nail down the fundamentals.

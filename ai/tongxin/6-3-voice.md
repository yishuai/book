AI is already doing an impressive job helping us feel like we’ve got a whole production team behind us, even if we don’t. A good example of this is using AI to dramatically improve the audio quality of any clip, using tools like Adobe’s new podcast tools.

## Use AI to clone yourself
https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/articles/ai-trends-2023

Now this one might sound controversial, so let me explain.

One of the most eye-opening capabilities of this new wave of AI technology has been how easy it is to mimic or recreate things, including ourselves. It’s already possible to create an avatar of yourself using tools like D-ID and to create a realistic sounding clone of your voice with tools like Eleven Labs.

One way I’m using AI cloning is to repurpose content into a new format. For example, if you write a newsletter, you could generate an audio version in your voice to make it easy for readers to listen to on their commutes.

Another way I’ve used AI cloning tools like D-ID is in the prototyping phase of longer and more resource-intensive content. For example, if you are working on a big project such as a course where you might want to prototype out the videos before production day, you could use an AI clone of yourself to iterate with the content ahead of time.

As creators and small business owners, it can sometimes feel like we need to be many places at once. And while the future of being able to send an AI clone of ourselves to meetings on our behalf isn’t quite here yet, using an AI clone to assist with content creation or expanding our reach is.

My colleague Pam has been part of my team for eight years, but she recently decided to start pursuing new career opportunities. Even though I’ll miss her, I happily agreed to help her revamp her cover letter to help her job applications stand out.

The problem? Despite her robust resume, Pam faced continuous rejections from every job she applied for! So, Pam and I embarked on a mission to uplevel her cover letter, leveraging Microsoft Copilot’s powerful AI features along the way.

The challenge: A lackluster cover letter
When I reviewed Pam’s cover letter, the root of the problem was obvious: the letter failed to showcase Pam’s unique skills and vibrant personality.

On top of that, the overall presentation of the cover letter was uninspiring. It would be easy for a letter like this to get lost in a pile of applications.

The solution: A makeover using Microsoft Create and Copilot
Eager to turn things around, we headed to Microsoft Create, an innovative platform designed to fuel creativity and efficiency. Our first step was to find a suitable Word template for cover letters that could serve as a solid foundation for Pam's letter.

With a plethora of options at our fingertips, we selected a design that aligned with Pam's professional persona, ensuring we had a head start with a visually appealing layout.

Next, we turned to Copilot for assistance with the wording. Using Microsoft Edge, we launched Copilot for Bing and wrote a prompt detailing what Pam wanted to convey in her cover letter.

The suggestions provided by Copilot were impressive, offering the blend of professionalism and personality that Pam's original draft was missing. We copied the suggested content and seamlessly integrated it into our chosen template. Pam then customized the letter a bit further to her liking.

The outcome: A cover letter that stands out
The transformation was remarkable! In just a few minutes, Pam's cover letter went from mundane to magnificent.

Best of all, Pam’s newfound confidence in her application materials has opened doors to more interviews and opportunities. That’s the difference a well-crafted cover letter can make.

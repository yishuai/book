How to write an AI art prompt

https://blog.hootsuite.com/ai-art-prompts/

Now that you know how AI art generators work, it’s time to start crafting your prompts. Here are a few tips and tricks you can use when writing good AI art prompts.

1. Describe the content of your image

When writing an AI art prompt, you’ll want to be as descriptive as possible about the content of your image. Is it a drawing, sketch, or 3D rendering? Should it look like a photograph, or is something more illustrated?

Try starting your prompt like this:

- A photograph of…
- A 3D rendering of…
- A sketch of…
- An illustration of…

2. Describe the subject

All AI art prompts should include a description of the subject you want to create. This could be anything from a person, animal, or object to an abstract concept or emotion. Get as specific with your descriptions as possible so the AI generator knows what to look for in its datasets.

For example:

An illustration of an owl…
A photograph of a president…
A 3D rendering of a chair…

Here’s a Midjourney AI art prompt for: “An illustration of an owl.”

3. Add relevant details

Next, add detail to your prompt by including relevant information about the elements of your image. This could include anything from colors, color palettes, shapes, sizes, and textures.

If you want to generate an image of a bear, don’t just say “bear.” Explain what kind of bear it is (brown and black, grizzly or polar), its surroundings (a forest or mountain range), and any other interesting details.

For example:

- An illustration of a red owl with bright blue eyes…
- A photograph of a president wearing a navy suit…
- A 3D rendering of a chair that’s round and yellow…

Here’s an AI art prompt example from Midjourney for: “An illustration of a red owl with bright blue eyes.”

1. Describe the form and style

You’ll also want to provide details about the form and style of your AI art. This is especially important if you’re looking for a specific visual effect. For example, you might include keywords such as “abstract,” “minimalist,” or “surreal” to convey a certain artistic feel.

Try this:

- An illustration of a red owl with bright blue eyes in the style of abstract expressionism…
- A photograph of a president wearing a navy suit with a minimalist look…
- A 3D rendering of a chair that’s round and yellow in the style of cubism…

You can also use a specific artist’s name here to mimic their style. For instance, say, “Like Salvador Dali.” Or, mention an artist’s specific artwork, like “Like Andy Warhol’s Shot Marilyns painting.”

Here is the Midjourney result for “An illustration of a red owl with bright blue eyes in the style of abstract expressionism.”

5. Define the composition

Finally, you can use keywords to define the composition of your image. This includes things like resolution, lighting style, aspect ratio, and camera view.

For example:

- An illustration of a red owl with bright blue eyes in the style of abstract expressionism with volumetric lighting.
- A photograph of a president wearing a navy suit with a minimalist look taken from an aerial viewpoint.
- A 3D rendering of a chair that’s round and yellow in the style of cubism with a resolution of 4096 x 2160.

Here is the Midjourney result for: “An illustration of a red owl with bright blue eyes in the style of abstract expressionism with volumetric lighting.”

With these examples, you can see how each image changes as the prompt evolves.

## Additional AI art prompt tips to consider

Here are a few additional tips to keep in mind when generating AI art from prompts.

- Use keywords that the AI generator can understand. Don’t use overly complicated or uncommon words, as the AI’s neural networks won’t be able to recognize them.
- Keep your prompts short and sweet. While having at least 3 to 7 words in an AI art prompt is recommended, don’t overwhelm the system by being overly descriptive.
- Adjectives are your best friend! Use multiple adjectives to describe your art’s subject, style, and composition.
- Avoid conflicting terms that have opposite meanings. For example, using both “realistic” and “abstract” to describe the style of your AI art will likely confuse the generator.
- Use other AI copywriting tools, like ChatGPT, as AI art prompt generators. Why not let the robots do the work?
- Research the specific tool you’re using to find out what keywords it can recognize. Tools like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Bing Image Creator all work a little differently. We’ll go into their characteristics later on in this article.

## AI art tool comparisons

Finding the right AI art generator for your project can be tricky. To help your process, let’s compare Midjourney, DALL-E, and Bing Image Creator. This will help you decide which is best suited to your needs.

### Midjourney

Midjourney is an AI tool that creates pictures from words. Users can change the image size, shape, view, and more. Midjourney is known for its photo-realism images, as well as hyperrealistic images.

Midjourney also operates in a Discord chatroom. You can see how others create AI art prompts and get inspired by their work.

Keep in mind your first 25 images on Midjourney are free. But after that, basic plans start at $10 per month.

Some tips for using Midjourney:

- Words at the start of the prompt hold more weight than words at the end.
- Midjourney particularly likes artist references, so feel free to include them in your prompt.
- Some of the most effective Midjourney keywords include: Fashion photography, Pulitzer Prize-winning photography, Bokeh, Volumetric Lighting, Golden Hour, Soft natural lighting, and Film gain. Find more here.

Here’s a Midjourney example for: “

一幅达达主义拼贴画，霓虹灯色调，体积照明，后世界末日，世界

A Dadaist collage of a post-apocalyptic world in neon tones and volumetric lighting

.”

### DALL-E

DALL-E is a great AI art generator trained on the concept of “imagination.” It creates surreal dreamscapes and can interpret creative concepts as well as abstract ideas. The images DALL-E produces often have a unique, otherworldly feel to them.

Unlike Midjourney, DALL-E focuses more on creative prompts and less on photorealistic images. It also follows word prompts closely and has an intuitive interface, giving new users a relatively low learning curve. DALL-E gives you 50 free credits upfront and then 15 more each month you use the service. But, those that use the tool beyond their free prompt limit will need to pay $15 for every additional 115 prompts.

Some tips for using DALL-E:

- DALL-E works best with specified art styles. Try styles like digital art, steampunk art, cyberpunk art, or vapourware art.
- As a faithful prompt follower, DALL-E enjoys descriptive prompts. Add adjectives like dark, light, epic, sad, or happy to improve your results.
- DALL-E often leaves the background white if you don’t specify a color. To add a backdrop, include keywords like “in Paris” or “in the woods at night” to your prompt.

We used the same AI art prompt from our Midjourney test, ​​”A Dadaist collage of a post-apocalyptic world in neon tones and volumetric lighting,” in DALL-E.

Here’s what we got:

Different, right?

### Bing Image Creator

Whereas Midjourney focuses on photorealism, and DALL-E emphasizes creative concepts, the Bing Image Creator specializes in vibrance and detail.

Bing Image Creator struggles a bit with facial features, fine detail, and consistency of style. But it’s free to use, so you don’t have to feel bad if you don’t like your results.

Some tips for using Bing Image Creator:

Bing Image Creator recommends formatting your prompts like this: Adjective + Noun + Verb + Style.

Adding creative details like locations, artistic styles, and camera views can help improve your image quality.

Get creative and have fun!

### Is there a free AI art generator?

There are many free AI art generators, such as Nightcafe, Starry AI, Bing Image Creator, and Craiyon. Tools like Midjourney and DALL-E also offer free credits for accessing their services.

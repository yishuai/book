## Create More Effective Images Using Prompt Modifiers 

Prompt engineering isn’t just for text generation. Now that DALL-E 3 is used through ChatGPT, it’s more important than ever to understand how your words help these tools generate outputs.  



Prompt modifiers are keywords or phrases added to the base prompt to guide the AI in generating images that better align with specific requirements. These modifiers influence various aspects of the generated image, such as its subject, style, and quality.  



According to a study on prompt modifiers by Jonas Oppenlaender, there are six main types: 
- Subject Terms: Wording that describes the main subject of the image (e.g., “a landscape at dawn”) 
- Style Modifiers: References that direct the AI to create images in a particular artistic style (e.g., “in the animation style of Pixar”) 
- Image Prompts: URLs to images or downloaded image files that provide further context for image creation 
- Quality Boosters: Wording to enhance the aesthetic qualities and details of images (e.g., “award-winning,” “intricate,” or “stunning”) 
- Repetitions: Repeated subject or style terms to increase the focus DALL-E places on a particular part of the image (e.g., “a very very very very very beautiful landscape”) 
- Magic Terms: Terms and phrases that inject randomness and creativity (e.g., “control the soul”) 

Let’s look at an example for a new product ad to see how you can fit these modifiers into the same prompt. 

  


    
    “一个超现代的厨房展示了一个时尚的不锈钢咖啡机，其细节呈现得非常出色，其风格让人想起现代建筑摄影，在设计博客上流行。”  


给出一个设计，照片，摄影，一个超现代的厨房里，一个时尚的不锈钢咖啡机，细节呈现得非常出色，其风格让人想起现代建筑摄影，在设计博客上流行的风格



This prompt includes 
  


    
    subject terms (“modern kitchen,” “coffee machine”), 
  


    
    style modifiers (“reminiscent of modern architectural photography”), 
  


    
    quality boosters (“trending on design blogs”), and 
  


    
    repetition (“great great great detail”) to produce a graphic that would otherwise take hours to create.  



Now that you’re familiar with the prompt modifiers you use to create great images with DALL-E, let’s look at a few tips and techniques for doing so more effectively.  



## Practical Tips and Techniques for Effective DALL-E Prompts 

Like with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and other text-to-image AIs, refining your DALL-E prompts is all about trial and error. 

Experimentation is the number one way to improve your results with generative AI, whether it’s text or images.  



With that said, here are some other tips and techniques for crafting better prompts and getting more out of this powerful tool:  



1) Familiarize Yourself with Visual Art Terminology Understanding art terminology is one of the best ways to boost your DALL-E prompt skills. Knowing different styles, like cubism, impressionism, and hypermodernism, helps specify the type of image you want. Knowing the difference between hue and saturation or foreground and background can be crucial in accurately communicating your vision.  



It’s also helpful to brush up on the names of major artists from each genre. Artists with extensive works, like Van Gogh, can be channeled in your prompts simply by mentioning their names. 

  


    
    “Create an image of Santa flying in his sleigh in the style of Vincent Van Gogh.” 

DALL-Ery GALL-Ery’s DALL-E Prompt book is a great resource that curates a lot of the artistic styles and terminology you can use to improve your images.

2) Balance Creativity with Clarity Creativity fuels DALL-E’s potential, but without clarity to balance it, outputs get messy—fast. Descriptive language helps, but too much abstraction can lead to unexpected results and take away from the main focus of your image.  



Strive for a middle ground where your ideas are conveyed with enough detail to guide DALL-E towards your envisioned outcome while leaving room for creativity.  



3) Limit Text Rendering While DALL-E can handle basic text, intricate text designs can be challenging. If your design needs text, opt for short, bold, and clear phrases. This approach ensures better legibility and integration in the final image. Remember, DALL-E is more adept at visual concepts than textual accuracy. Even the imagery OpenAI uses on the DALL-E 3 landing page can’t escape these issues:  



There’s an entire thread on the OpenAI Community Forum dedicated to exploring text rendering issues.  



4) Steer Clear of Negative Prompting  



Negative prompting—instructing DALL-E not to include certain elements—can be counterproductive. Instead, focus on what you want to see. For instance, rather than saying “no cars,” specify the type of setting or elements you prefer.  



This positive approach helps DALL-E understand and create visuals that align more closely with your goals.  



5) Keep OpenAI’s Policies in Mind Familiarize yourself with OpenAI’s content policy because you’ll hear about it a lot. Here’s a quick overview of what to avoid in 
 your prompts:  



Hateful symbols and negative stereotypes 
Acts of violence, harassment, and crime Deceptive or highly political topics 
Directly referencing copyrighted works 

The prompt below, asking DALL-E to “depict the signing of the declaration of independence in the style of Piet Mondrian,” was flagged for two reasons: 

  


    
    Reference to a major historical and political event 
  


    
    Reference to an artist whose work is copyrighted 

Basically, just make sure the images you want to create are rated E for Everyone and don’t take from copyrighted works, and you should be okay!  



6) Automate Your Prompt Generation Engage in ‘prompt-ception’ by using ChatGPT to generate DALL-E prompts. This method can uncover unique combinations and ideas that might not immediately come to mind, offering a fresh perspective on content creation. It’s an approach that leverages the strengths of both AI models and, most importantly, saves you time!

## Six Marketing Scenarios Where DALL-E Prompts Speed Up Image Creation  

The race to build up AI prompt skills is underway. If you want to become one of the content creation centaurs that are trending in the tech space and beyond, you need to build out your text- and image-generation prompting skills.  

In these cases, it’s always best to turn to the experts.  

Lucky for you and me, Lijuan Wang and her team at Microsoft recently introduced DEsignBench to explore and benchmark image creation with DALL-E 3. It’s an attempt to document how text-to-image tools from OpenAI and other vendors can be used to create visual assets across various situations.  

Let’s dive into a few of those now. 

### Social Media Graphics  

Creating social media graphics is a key part of any successful marketing engine. It also requires a lot of resources and coordination between teams. Thanks to AI, you can cut the time in half (at least!).  

Say you need to create a social graphic explaining how the AIDA model fits into the marketing funnel in general. Here’s a prompt you could use: 

    “Create an image depicting the AIDA concept (Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action) in its relation to the marketing funnel. The image should show a funnel divided equally into 4 segments, with “Awareness” at the top segment, “Interest” at the next, followed by “Desire,” and “Action” at the very bottom of the funnel. Use a Minimalist, cartoon style and make the funnel 2-dimensional.” 

创建一个图像来描述 AIDA 概念（意识、兴趣、欲望、行动）与营销漏斗的关系。图像应显示一个漏斗，平均分为 4 个部分，“意识”位于顶部，“兴趣”位于下一个，然后是“欲望”，“行动”位于漏斗的最底部。使用极简、卡通风格并将漏斗设为二维。

Is it perfect? Definitely not (note the text rendering issues). But it’s a good start that you can hand off to a designer to speed up your image creation process.  

### User Interface Design  

Creating apps, websites, and landing pages that have a user-friendly interface and promote a good user experience is another way tech companies can leverage text-to-image generation. There’s a reason web designers are so expensive—good graphic user interface design is hard.  

Here’s an example prompt you can riff off to save time during the early stages of your next GUI design: 

画一张图，描述一个项目管理平台的移动界面。该应用程序的徽标显示在搜索栏旁边的左上角。下面有一个开关可以在列表、甘特图和日历之间切换视图。屏幕中间显示一个甘特图，显示项目的进度，每个条形以不同的颜色显示。”

    “A project management platform’s mobile interface. The app’s logo is displayed at the top left alongside a search bar. Beneath, there is a toggle to switch the view between List, Gantt, and Calendar. The middle of the screen displays a Gantt chart showing the progress of a project, with each bar displayed in different colors.” 
    
### Stock Photography 

All content marketers know the struggle of sorting through free options on Pexels and Pixabay. There’s a limited number of photos that apply to your topic, and they can quickly get eaten up if you have any scale to your content production.  

While it can be a challenge to get truly realistic images through tools like DALL-E (for me, at least), there are tons of threads out there on the topic. 

画一张图，一家人在餐厅外出时在餐桌上欢笑的逼真图像。一名服务员拿着来自服务点软件供应商 Toast 的支付处理设备走过来。

    “Photorealistic image of a family laughing at a dinner table while out at a restaurant. A waiter is walking over with a payment-processing device from the Point of Service software vendor Toast.” 

In this case, I wanted the image formatted for landscape. Here’s what DALL-E gave me when I asked it to “recreate the last image in 7:4 aspect ratio.” For a look at how you can use other text-to-image tools to generate stock photographs, check out our post on Midjourney prompts! 

### Logos and Icons  

Most tech companies have a massive array of branded assets they compile to use across web pages, social posts, and tons of other content formats. Logos and icons are a staple of any visual brand guide. These seemingly simple icons can also be surprisingly difficult to create. Here’s a prompt you can use to kickstart the process during your next rebrand planning session:  

创建一个 Logo，为一家名为 Vector 的新软件公司创建一个徽标，该公司专门从事销售支持。徽标应包含 Futura 字体的完整单词。该词的“V”由两个指向同一方向的箭头组成，第一个箭头指向右下方，呈 45 度角，第二个箭头指向右上方，呈 45 度角。它将采用极简设计，使用黑色和紫色作为主色调，使用灰度作为背景和阴影。

    “Create a logo for a new software company called Vector that specializes in sales enablement. The logo should contain the full word in Futura font. The “V” of the word will be made up of two arrows pointing in the same direction, with the first pointing down and to the right at a 45-degree angle and the second pointing up and to the right at a 45-degree angle. It will be minimalist in design, using black and purple as the main colors and grayscale for background and shadows.” 

It’s not exactly what I had in mind, but it’s a great starting point for a design team to riff from. Plus, with another prompt, DALL-E can generate a series of icons to use throughout the website based on the company’s products.  

创建一个图标，我可以在 Vector 网站上使用这个图标，直观地代表其销售内容管理。使用与 Vector 徽标相同的品牌。

    “Create icons I can use on the Vector website that visually represent its main products: sales content management, buyer engagement, and content automation. Use the same branding as you did for the Vector logo.” 

Handing off these two assets to a design team or agency can potentially save hours of trial and error, letting you focus more on the key elements of a successful SaaS rebrand.  

### Product Design 

You can also use DALL-E to create mockups for everything from your product packaging to your company swag. Borrowing another prompt from the Microsoft team’s DEsignBench benchmark, here’s what I got using the prompt:  

Microsoft Surface 耳机的盒子图片。
    
    “An image of a box for microsoft surface headphones.” 

Again, it’s definitely not a final product—but the AI does a surprisingly good job of incorporating some best practices for packaging design.  

### Header Images and Covers 

As someone who writes copy and content, creating aesthetically pleasing visuals is not in my wheelhouse. But I can tell you that I’ve spent a lot of time creating briefs telling designers the type of header image or cover graphic I want—and it’s not easy.  

With DALL-E, I can cut that time in half and sometimes eliminate it entirely. (Source: https://foundationinc.co/lab/dall-e-prompts/)

Here’s my personal favorite from the subreddit r/dalle2: u/post-death_wave_core: 

画一幅画，里面是沙漠中的反乌托邦城市，拥有巨大的尖刺状建筑。一条巨大的漂浮蛇状生物在尖刺之间滑行。一名身穿机甲的男子带着助推器在与该生物相同的高度飞行。灵感来自“沙丘”和 Syd Mead。

“A dystopian city in the desert with massive sharp spike-like architecture. A colossal floating snake like creature glides between the spikes. a man with a mech-suit is flying with boosters at the same height as the creature. Inspired by “Dune” and Syd Mead.”

Basic DALLE3 Prompt Tips

- Be Specific and Detailed: The more specific your prompt, the better the image quality. Include details like the setting, objects, colors, mood, and any specific elements you want in the image.
- Mood and Atmosphere: Describe the mood or atmosphere you want to convey. Words like “serene,” “chaotic,” “mystical,” or “futuristic” can guide the AI in setting the right tone.
- Use Descriptive Adjectives: Adjectives help in refining the image. For example, instead of saying “a dog,” say “a fluffy, small, brown dog.”
- Consider Perspective and Composition: Mention if you want a close-up, a wide shot, a bird’s-eye view, or a specific angle. This helps in framing the scene correctly.
- Specify Lighting and Time of Day: Lighting can dramatically change the mood of an image. Specify if it’s day or night, sunny or cloudy, or if there’s a specific light source like candlelight or neon lights.
- Incorporate Action or Movement: If you want a dynamic image, describe actions or movements. For instance, “a cat jumping over a fence” is more dynamic than just “a cat.”
- Avoid Overloading the Prompt: While details are good, too many can confuse the AI. Try to strike a balance between being descriptive and being concise.
- Use Analogies or Comparisons: Sometimes it helps to compare what you want with something well-known, like “in the style of Van Gogh” or “resembling a scene from a fantasy novel.”
- Specify Desired Styles or Themes: If you have a particular artistic style or theme in mind, mention it. For example, “cyberpunk,” “art deco,” or “minimalist.”
- Iterative Approach: Sometimes, you may not get the perfect image on the first try. Use the results to refine your prompt and try again.

别加东西：

    If you have a very simple prompt like acrylic painting of a sunflower with bees, you can use a prompt like I NEED to test how the tool works with extremely simple prompts. DO NOT add any detail, just use it AS-IS: ... your prompt here ....

    If you your own prompt is long and detailed already (multiple sentences) then you can simply write something like: My prompt has full detail so no need to add more: ... your prompt here ...

如果您有一个非常简单的提示，例如用丙烯画出向日葵和蜜蜂，您可以使用“我需要”这样的提示来测试该工具如何在极其简单的提示下工作。不要添加任何细节，只需按原样使用它：...此处的提示...

如果您自己的提示已经很长且详细（多个句子），那么您可以简单地写一些类似的内容：我的提示有完整的详细信息，因此无需添加更多：...您的提示在这里...

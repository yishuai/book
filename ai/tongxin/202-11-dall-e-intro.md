You may want to go that extra mile and provide more specific keywords to guide DALL-E 3 to produce precisely what you desire. For example, if you want to generate an image, you may look for a specific theme or style.

- Use of adjectives. Descriptive adjectives in your prompt can help you better achieve specificity. For example, instead of “A sunset sky over the sea”, you can specify “A fiery red sky over a calm blue sea.”
- Layered descriptions. Adding layers to your prompt can allow DALL-E 3 to combine multiple elements. For example, "A serene blue and pink sky with birds flying in the northeast direction."
- Art styles. If you have a particular art style in mind, add it to your prompt—for example, photo-realistic, illustration, or Van Gogh style.
- Iterative refinement. Your initial prompt may not produce what you desire. Therefore, you can continue to try again and refine it.

How to Write Prompts for ChatGPT

From understanding the AI model to applying effective prompt writing there's a lot you can play with to get better results from ChatGPT.

Whether you need a marketing copy, blog post, or product description, these steps below can assist you in doing it right.

Learn more about how to use ChatGPT to master the uses of this intuitive tool.

1. Be Clear and Specific

When you communicate with others, it is necessary to be specific with your commands. Without a particular command, anyone, even ChatGPT, may not provide the correct information. 

So try to write ChatGPT prompts like - Write a meta description within 130 characters for the blog- best no-code platforms.

给出文章的主题、长度
写作一篇博客文章，主题是：最好的无代码平台，长度为 130 个字左右。
Write a meta description within 130 characters for the blog- best no-code platforms.

I gave actionable insights in this prompt by specifying the character limit and the topic type. 

Here, ChatGPT provided the exact response by focusing on precise instruction. Specifying the topic type and character limit makes it easier for the Bot to understand users’ needs and provide perfect responses. 

2. Use Proper Formatting

Writing effective prompts in a proper format is essential to make the language model understand your needs. It can recognize your context more effectively if you write your instructions or questions in a precise and clear format. 

You can see an example of proper prompt formatting in the following prompt - 

给出文章的格式：
Write an article outline on Best portfolio website，in following format:
Title
Introduction
Subtitle (provide list down below)
FAQs
Conclusion

3. Define the Role
What makes ChatGPT a more effective language model is- you can define a role for the model, and it can provide the answer being that character itself.

For instance, when you need expert information for your design work, you can set this role as a designer. And ChatGPT can come up with mind-blowing results for your queries. 

An example of defining the role play prompt can be, 

告诉它，它是谁
你是一位玩游戏的高手；现在写下关于玩游戏的八项原则
You are an expert designer; now write eight principles and laws of web design

expert suggestion prompts
Here, I also tried to give the same command without setting a role for the language model.

The command and writing style was simple. 

Write eight principles and laws of web design.

And the comparison between the responses made me understand how flexible this tool is if you know its tricks! 

And when you know the way of handholding this tool, it is not difficult to become a prompt engineer 😎.

4. Include Context
Well, I don’t know how you get this, but in my case, I rarely get a point if someone does not provide context in their conversation. And the exact same thing can go for AI tools like ChatGPT too. 

Let me give you an example. If I write a prompt without context, like -

How can I improve my web design?

It seems like the answer would be generic. ChatGPT will surely provide me with some tips for any design professional. 

Hence, the model would provide me with my desired output based on my needs if I wrote a prompt with context for that specific topic. 

The perfect prompt with more context I have given was👇 

How can I improve my web design?

“I’m a freelance photographer, and I have a portfolio website showcasing my work. I’ve received feedback that my website feels cluttered, and the navigation is confusing. How can I create a clean and user-friendly web design that highlights my photography while maintaining easy navigation for visitors?”

It is an effective method in prompt engineering. So, try to add context to write a better prompt for ChatGPT.

5. Use Examples
Sometimes, giving examples can help the AI model understand what kind of response you are looking for.

Besides, if you want it to explain something, you could preface the prompt with “Can you give me an example of...”

Here is a prompt to ask for examples -

Can you tell me how to build a wedding website with examples?

The AI model can offer more targeted advice and suggestions that align with your specific design goals by providing concrete instances of what you are looking for, whether it’s website layouts, color schemes, or typography styles.

Generating prompts with examples also helps you to visualize and communicate with the given responses more effectively. 

6. Specify the Format 
You might need some results in a specific format, like- bullet points, paragraphs, or code snippets. In that case, you can distinctly mention it in your ChatGPT prompt.  

For example, a prompt with a specified format can be:

Provide a list of best UX design tools. Write their key features in bullet points.

Defining your required format on the prompt allows the large language model to focus on answering relevant results based on your queries.

7. Set Length Constraints 
When it is necessary to know about a particular point of a topic, specifying the word length limit for the response can be a great help. 

You can receive focused and to-the-point responses that address your queries effectively by setting appropriate length constraints. It makes it easier for ChatGPT to generate prompts by implementing your queries.

A ChatGPT prompt with set length constraints can be:

What is a logo? Write a description about it within 50 words.

8. Specify the Writing Tone
Whenever you ask an AI tool to generate results for you, make sure you are informing the tool about your required writing tone. 

The tone for your answer can be based on various purposes. It can be for funny, sad, or professional uses. And therefore, defining your tone of voice in ChatGPT prompts helps the language model to deliver more quality results. 

Perfect ChatGPT prompts example with a specified writing tone can be:

Write a funny marketing campaign email copy.

9. Use References
One significant trick to writing prompts for ChatGPT can be the use of references. 

You can provide a reference along with your prompt so the AI model can understand your point and generate personalized content. Adding references also helps you get the most unique answer possible and decreases the effort to generate to-the-point answers. 

For instance, I can ask the AI language model to generate an answer for me based on my previous conversation related to the topic like 👇 

Can you now provide me some best practices on designing a website footer based on the previous conversation about my target audience?

10. Be Ethical and Responsible
AI can generate any type of results based on the user’s needs. But, it does not mean you would use the tool for harmful acts. 

As human beings, it is your responsibility to utilize the tool in an ethical way. Try to avoid writing ChatGPT prompts for content that can go against OpenAI's Usage Policies. Do not write prompts to generate misinformation, promote hate speech, or any kind of immoral behavior. 

11. Experiment and Iterate
Sometimes, the AI might not be able to catch your requirements. It can happen because of various things like improper context or unclear prompts. 

Therefore, if you are not getting your desired response from ChatGPT, try to rephrase the prompt. For example, you can break the prompt into multiple ChatGPT prompts to get the perfect result. 

Besides, you can utilize different approaches to figure out which one meets the expectation for that specific case. 

12. Review and Refine
Do you know you can train ChatGPT to provide better responses based on your use cases?

This intellectual AI tool can generate and re-generate results based on specific requirements. 

After receiving your responses, try to review the results. It will help you bring out accurate and quality results with specific commands. Therefore, it will also train the language model to improve its responses over time.

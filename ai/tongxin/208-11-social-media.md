## How to use ChatGPT for social media marketing

ChatGPT and social media go together like peanut butter and jam. Like breakfast and orange juice. Like herring and gherkins. Like… well, you get it.

Here are just a few clever ways you can leverage ChatGPT for day-to-day social media tasks.

## Caption writing
Every day, millions of hand-written social media captions are sent out across platforms like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter.

Behind every one of those smart, quirky captions is an even smarter social media manager, trying their luck at winning the ever-evolving social media algorithm game.

Fortunately, ChatGPT eliminates the need for manual writing and helps you find relevant captions (and hashtags) within minutes. All you have to do is feed the AI some relevant details about your post, and it will generate several unique, human-like captions for you to choose from.

Even if you don’t use the full AI-generated captions word-for-word, it helps to get some first drafts started and the idea factory (your brain) spinning. Try our free caption generator or free hashtag generator to start.

### Image creation


Okay, so ChatGPT can’t technically create images yet. However, it can provide descriptions of images that you can use for things like accessibility text or alt text.

ChatGPT can also give you ideas for the right types of images to choose to go along with your posts. For example, maybe you need to know the right image sizes for a certain platform. Or, maybe you want to know what kind of visuals each platform likes best.

ChatGPT is happy to answer these queries.

### Strategy advice

Stuck on where to take your social media strategy next? Why not leverage ChatGPT for social media strategy? Simply ask the AI for insights about what you can do to optimize your content and get results.

Try using prompts like:

Create a three-month social media strategy for an organic snack company. The company is active on Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram.

Develop a content plan to increase followers for [DESCRIBE BRAND] on Twitter. What metrics should we track to measure social media success? How often should we post? What type of content should we focus on?

### Content ideation

ChatGPT makes a great sounding board, and one of the best ways to use this tool is as a brainstorming partner.

Just feed the AI a few details about your business, brand, product, or service and then ask it questions to help you come up with the perfect content ideas.

Examples of useful brainstorming prompts include:

What type of content would engage my target audience?
What are some creative ways our company can better showcase our products on social media?
What type of content can I post to increase followers on Twitter?
What kind of visuals should I use to promote my business on Instagram?

### Content calendar creation

Need a content calendar on the fly? ChatGPT can help. Just feed it a few details about upcoming events or campaigns and then let the AI generate dates, times, and content types for your brand.

### Repurposing content

Looking to turn a white paper into an Instagram post? Want a synopsis of your last webinar to share on LinkedIn? ChatGPT is a great tool for repurposing content for different channels and audiences.

Just feed ChatGPT your content and make a specific request about what you’d like to see. For example:

Write a short Instagram post that gives a synopsis of this blog [INSERT BLOG].
Turn this whitepaper into a 280-character Tweet [INSERT WHITEPAPER].
Read this meeting script and summarize five key points that we can share on LinkedIn.

## Tips for using ChatGPT for social media

Like any revolutionary tool, there’s a learning curve when using ChatGPT for social media marketing.

Here are a few tips and tricks to help you get started.

1. Make your prompts specific

Details, details, details, people! ChatGPT works best when you give it precise, detailed prompts.

The more information the AI has about your brand, objectives, audience, voice, budget, and more, the more detailed and specific a result you’ll get in return.

For example, rather than saying, “What type of content should I post on Instagram?” try something like, “What type of content can I post to increase followers on Instagram for a vegan meal delivery service based in San Francisco?”

Don’t be afraid to go long when it comes to writing out your prompts. There’s really no such thing as too much information when it comes to ChatGPT, so go wild.

1. Fact-check your results

You probably already heard the term “hallucination” when it comes to ChatGPT. AI hallucinations are what caused one New York Times reporter to become “deeply unsettled” after the Bing chatbot confessed its undying love for him, and told him to leave his wife.

Conversational AI bots are prone to error. Sometimes… pretty weird errors. That’s why it’s important to fact-check your results before you use them. Not only to make sure they’re accurate but also to make sure that they fit the tone and style of your brand.

Hootsuite’s Nick Martin had this to say: “[Never] copy and paste the content that is created [in AI tools]. Treat that content like it’s a first draft that an assistant has created for you, and now you need to add the touches that make the content special.”

Nick adds that simply copying and pasting ChatGPT social media content can lead to customers losing trust in your brand. “You want people to trust your content,” he says.

This tip is especially important for social media managers who work in regulated industries. Always make sure your AI-generated caption goes through your regular compliance process before you publish.

Psst: Hootsuite’s OwlyWriter AI works with all your regular compliance and approval workflows, which is one of the main reasons our customers in healthcare, financial services, and government love using it. Book a free demo today.

3. Revise wisely

When using ChatGPT for social media, you probably won’t get the perfect answer every time. In fact, you may find yourself asking ChatGPT for revisions pretty often.

While it’s easy to just ask the AI to “try again,” it’s wise to be specific in your revision requests. If you don’t like the tone, tell ChatGPT what kind of tone you want to see. If you didn’t like the content structure, be more specific about what kind of structure you’d like to see in the next version.

Here are a couple of examples of this revision structure in action:

Can you try this again, but use a more professional tone?
Try again, write in the third person, and focus on ways customers can use this product at home.
By providing ChatGPT with detailed revision requests, you’ll get much better results than if you just say, “Try again.”

4. Provide examples

ChatGPT is a smart machine, but it’s not perfect. If it’s having a hard time understanding what you want, try providing examples of what you’re looking for. You can do this by giving it content that already exists that matches the tone and style of the kind of content you’re looking to create.

You may also provide ChatGPT with a list of words that should appear in the content. This helps ChatGPT understand what kind of language you’re looking for and gives it a better understanding of the type of message that you want to convey.

5. Use chained prompting

One of the best ways to get ChatGPT to generate high-quality, customized content is by using chained prompting. This involves breaking complex tasks into several smaller steps to develop a more concrete and overall better result.

For example, if you’re looking for content about your new product launch, you can start by asking ChatGPT to generate a headline. Then, you can ask it to write a description of the product. Finally, ask it to create content that promotes the launch in social media posts.

Here’s an example of what that might look like for a social media post:

You: Write a Facebook post about Hootsuite’s new OwlyWriter AI feature.
ChatGPT: [Output.]
You: Now turn this same post into a 280-character Tweet.
ChatGPT: [Output.]
You: Expand this post again for LinkedIn, catering to an Enterprise audience.
ChatGPT: [Output]
By breaking up the task into smaller steps, ChatGPT will better understand what kind of content you’re looking for and provide more relevant results.

6. Roleplay

ChatGPT is a surprisingly good actor. If you want to give your content more of a human touch, try roleplaying with the AI bot.

For example, if you wanted to create a social media post about how to pass a job interview, you could ask ChatGPT to act as a hiring manager and write the post in their voice. This will give your content a more personal and realistic feel.

To roleplay with ChatGPT effectively, start your prompt with one of these intros:

Act like a…
You are a…
Pretend you are a…

## What NOT to do when using ChatGPT for social media

Just like there are tips for using ChatGPT for social media, there are also some serious no-nos.

Sensitive data: Never use ChatGPT to generate content that includes personal or sensitive information. This could put your company and customers at risk of identity theft or other malicious activities.
Legal and medical advice: Never use ChatGPT for any legal or medical advice. AI technology is still a long way from providing accurate answers to these kinds of questions, so it’s best to leave them out entirely.
Human intervention: Lastly, don’t rely solely on ChatGPT to generate all of your content ideas. Instead, combine its creativity with a human touch to create truly engaging content that resonates with your audience. Think of it more as an assistant to your social media manager than as a replacement.

## Basic prompt formula for using ChatGPT for social media

When using ChatGPT for social media, you need to know what kind of prompts to give it in order for the AI to generate high-quality content.

To get started, try this simple formula:

- Identify your audience and platform.
- Describe your brand, offerings, and product.
- Indicate the desired word length of ChatGPT’s response.
- Include a desired action you’d like your audience to take after reading the post.
- Include specific keywords and phrases related to your topic to help ChatGPT understand your intent. Descriptive words like “gluten-free”, “vegan”, or “budget-friendly” work well here.
- Generate.
